Batu Ferringhi Hidden Gems,4.5,"Jalan Batu Ferringhi, Batu Ferringhi",Malaysia,None,Penang,https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/Attraction_Review-g635527-d15737342-Reviews-Batu_Ferringhi_Hidden_Gems-Batu_Ferringhi_Penang_Island_Penang.html,MoPekoe,"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,97,158,"This is a relaxing ‘morning walk/jog’ or light hike type activity, where the loop trail is about 6-7km. Fitness level required: Low, flat terrain. Attractive features: Serenity, peace, calm, pre-war rustic colonial heritage building structures within the catchment area, bathe under dam waterfall, bathe under various waterfalls and stream rock pools, mix of secluded tarred road, light forest ferny trail, and main road.The trail is through the Penang Water Authority (Malay: Perbadanan Bekalan Air (PBA)): Penang water supply agency) water catchment and processing area. The catchment area is called “Batu Ferringhi Aqueduct”, and associated with it, “Batu Ferringhi Dam” (also known as “Batu Ferringhi Waterfall”). The dam is a small one, more of a weir. The dam/waterfall is in an area in Batu Ferringhi unofficially called “Chin Farm” because of a small freshwater fish farm there that draws on the stream water in that area of streams, waterfalls and stream rock pools.This trail is through secluded, quiet tarred road within the restricted access catchment area, light wild forest trail, then normal coastal main road looping back to the starting point (assuming you parked your car at the starting point).The PBA aqueduct, catchment and dam area is a restricted controlled access area. But, if you are a casual stroller or jogger, the PBA is quite flexible to let you access, traverse through, on the basis that they trust you to behave yourself.On getting to starting point. If by bus, assuming you start from Georgetown, take the government “Rapid Transit” public bus from the town bus terminus (“Komtar” or “Pengkalan Weld” (Weld Quay) to Batu Ferringhi. Buses to “Batu Ferringhi” or “Telok Bahang” (one village westwards beyond “Batu Ferringhi”) will get you there. Alight at the “Holiday Inn Resort” hotel at Batu Ferringhi, along the main coastal road. (This is the area of the Batu Ferringhi night market.) The hotel is on the sea-side. Cross the main road to the land-side directly opposite. Walk upslope on “Jalan Sungai 1”. Further upslope, you will see Uplands International School on right, at junction. Turn right at this junction. Go past this school. Further uproad/slope, you see a fenced-up “Pasar Batu Ferringhi” (Batu Ferringhi Market), a building complex with carpark. I think this is an unused market building complex, looks abandoned and empty. Near this building complex, you see a cul-de-sac, and a blue-colored guardhouse, and a gate. This is the PBA guardhouse into the catchment area. There may or may not be a guard there. If no guard, you will see a sign-in register book, sign-in here.If you drove, park your car at this cul-de-sac. Morning walkers park their cars in this unofficial carpark.You are on a tarred road. The high ground water catchment area transports you to a serene calm world of its own. Observe the raw unprocessed water flowing in the white aqueduct. Observe the rustic classic white water-control building structures. Enjoy the serenity. You may meet some bullying, aggressive monkeys along the tarred road. Do not show that you are intimidated by them, or they will bully and harass you. Meet aggression with aggressive. Fight fire with fire. Growl at them. Stomp your feet. A hiking pole will be useful, not to hurt them, but to ward them off. Do not cower.You come to a fork, as marked by a classic cannon on elevated ground. Detour upslope to take the cannon direction, follow the road. When done, return to this cannon junction, to continue.When back to the cannon landmark, continue on the main tarred road. You will come to a tranquil dammed stream. This is “Batu Ferringhi Dam/Waterfall”. A mini-dam, a weir. There may or may not be waterfall water flow depending on whether it is dry or wet season. This is, sort of, the start of the so-called “Chin Farm” area of mini-waterfall cascades, stream pools. Descend from the dam top, to the rocky stream bed bottom (parts of it above water, but slippery, be careful), via a steep path. If the waterfall and stream water are in full flourish typically in the wet/rainy season, picnic, bathe, relax here. Enjoy the natural serenity.To carry on beyond the dam, stand on the rocky stream bed, your back to the dam, facing downstream. Turn right, follow the trail. You will see an overhead huge fat water pipe, over a pretty stream rock pool.  You will pass a luxuriant area of ferns. Under bright sunlight, this green sea of ferns shimmers brilliantly, a beautiful sight.Further, you see a dull water tower structure, and a broken fence perimeter. Beyond this fence, you exit the PBA water catchment area. As you hike along the trail, you hear the sound of the stream on your right. Watch out for a rough access forest path that gets you to the rocky area of stream, mini-waterfalls and stream rockpools. This is the so-called “Chin Farm Waterfalls” (more cascades than waterfalls) area. This is a pretty, serene area ideal for bathing, picnic, photography and chilling. It may not be much in the dry season, but is quite wonderful in the wetter months when the water is in full flow. There is a part of the stream where there is a rock depression. You can tuck yourself into this cocoon of a depression, chill, and have the stream water gush past, caressing and massaging your body. For your information, the “Chin Farm” fish farmer’s house is downstream. You may hear his guard dogs bark.Once you are done bathing and chilling, rejoin the trail. Continue in seaward direction towards the main “Jalan Batu Ferringhi” coastal road. On joining the main road, turn right in Georgetown-direction to get back to the PBA guardhouse starting point, if you had parked your car there. If you do this, you would have covered 6-7km in a loop.For your information, separate from the above hike, the “Batu Ferringhi Dam/Waterfall” is also the start-point for the “Batu Ferringhi - Bukit Laksamana - Penang Hill” hike, the longest, most arduous hike on the island, fitness level Medium-High, see my other Tripadvisor post on this hike.",Jul 2019,June 2019,Friends

Well, I googlemapped it and it turn out to be about 1.6 kilometers from the hotel we were staying.  I figured out a route along the beach, turned into the main road and crossed it, turned left at an Indian restaurant and found the unmarked road that led into the jungle.  We hiked a few hundred meters up a gravel road.  Yes,  there were several unfinished construction sites along the gravel road and some trash but the walk was pleasant enough.After about 400 meters from the road, there was a house with some barking dogs, a small old rusting bridge, the road turned into a swampy trail.  My girlfriend and I managed to avoid the boggy parts and advanced up the rocks, following the stream to the waterfalls and there was no one there.  It was pretty.  There were some macaque monkeys chattering in the distance but they left us alone.We didn't take a dip but we just lounged around and enjoyed the butterflies and dragonflies as the dipped around the waters around our feet.

In a visit in April 2018 with my wife, we learned that the path is now essentially an eyesore with rubbish strewn willy-nilly and the landscape appears to be used as a landfill site. It was painful to see nature being treated in such a manner. The environmental protection authorities (if they ever decide to undertake any proper investigation/enforcement work) should conduct a visit to the place without delay!However the waterfall itself is a great place. We got there early around 8.30 am and had the whole place to ourselves except for a troop of macaque monkeys basking in the sun on boulders. Be careful when climbing up the waterfall as it can be very slippery due to moss growing on parts where the flow of the water isn't strong. It was fantastic to immerse ourselves in breathtaking series of cascades fringed by forest foliage then plunge right into refreshing pools.The volume of the cascade would depend on the extent of recent rain, which would increase or decrease the flow.

A poster mentioned the really nice patchouli soap they bought from the Indochine Natural shop. I was immediately interested because Natural (unsweetened) Patchouli scented body products and diffusers are so hard to find nowadays! I searched the indochinenatural.com website and found pictures and information on their products; there is a great picture of an old apothecary chest with drawers labelled 'Shampoo', 'Body wash', 'Facewash', 'Soap' and other categories of products available. A description and the purchase price of each product is displayed when one clicks on a drawer!This place immediately became #1 on my list of 'things to do’ in Penang!I was not disappointed with my visit to Indochine Natural at Tanjung Bungah which is a short trip by grab car from Georgetown. I was so lucky to speak to Dr Mike Thair, Co Founder and the person who researches the skin care products and their wonderful plant-based fragrances, he explained that no synthetic ingredients are used in the products they sell. They have quite a range of products and a variety of fragrances including; patchouli, lavender, geranium, lemongrass, a number of spices (cloves, cinnamon, star anise) and litsea, a citron-like fragrance I have never encountered before!I ended up buying patchouli soap, a lovely gift box containing 5 small bottles of face wash, body wash and shampoo. My favourite buy was the Litsea Patchouli Face Wash which I opened yesterday and words can't do justice to the intriguing combination of fragrances and the way they reached my senses in stages and then lingered on my skin long after using the face wash. Now I wish I had bought more, there were individual essential oils too - next time! I want to share my wonderful enlightenment as best I can - it was a ""to die for"" experience the first time I washed my face using the Litsea Patchouli face wash – the fragrances came and went so mysteriously, individually then as a combination - it was unreal - first there was a sharp fresh smell (citrus I think) then there was a totally different, velvety, sultry, deep, dark, cold foresty fragrance which seemed to come from a totally different place - this was patchouli but with added spikes of something I can't describe which gave a different olfactory experience - I felt as if I was in a soothing, dark, green forest - then there was a new, different, smooth fragrance I felt floating all around me, probably litsea and patchouli combined - it was really magical, like being in a different land!

The variety of fruits and flowers and the freshness of them takes to back there. There are a couple of Coffee Houses, very deceptive as you get much much more than what the name suggests. The hot white coffee is amazing. You can try the barley water, though I didn't like it much. The main reason we kept going back was for the food. They are opened only until 1pm. So you can do a breakfast or brunch. And you don't get tired eating all that food. In my one week that I was in Penang, I must have had breakfast at least 5 times there. The chicken porridge is yum, so are the pork buns, or the chicken rice, or soupy noodles. You can practically try a new dish everyday. And then end the meal with sweet coconut water. The chap selling the coconuts is outside the market. One of the coffee houses is at the market place and the other is just outside called Kedai Kopi Sin Lee Hin. Both are great.

We got there at 6pm and it was already packed and the prawn was almost gone!  (We weren't impressed with other kinds of fish, squid or chicken liver.)-The siew mai at the steamed bun stall was great.  The chicken sticky rice might be the best chicken sticky rice we've ever had.-We're big lovers of Appam, which is hard to find. We were grateful the vendor was there even on a rainy day (60c/pc)  -Rambutan at the fruit stall (we went to the front one by mistake) was the best and cheapest (RM4/kg.

Sorry for the confusion.2) Nasi Melayu--do not miss the home cooked treats at rock bottom prices located at the very beginning of the hawker center nearest to the bus terminal. She serves her food from stainless steel chafing dishes. And she has a newspaper article about her food posted on the wall in her stall. Her chicken rendang is always awesome. 3) Popiah--beside Famous Ah Hock Chicken Rice stall. Try one roll plain, one roll with chili. These rolls are addictive. The uncle is very attentive to his craft, and will ask you what you think of his food. Be honest. :)4) Nonya Economy Rice--smack in the middle of the hawker center, between the Fish Broth Kway Teow Tng and Uncle Robert's Hong Kong Har Cheong Fun is this simple economy rice stall. Her Achar is renown, as is the Salt Fish Curry. Sample her reasonably priced dishes and you will see why scores of aunties swarm her in the early morning with their own to-go containers to load up for their day!NIGHT MARKET--TUESDAYa) Ric's Pork Burgers are no longer there.b) Grilled Squid is also gone (sob).here is a virtual tour if you walked one round:c) Nasi Melayu/Tomato--set up promptly at 6pm on the tables at the mouth of the parking closest to the market (on the way in from the bus terminal it is on the right). Line forms quickly and jumps all the best food, especially the beef rendang. d) Corn Dogs--beside Uncle Bob Chicken. My daughter adores these corn-dogs... (sob)e) Kerabu Beehoon--cross the parking lot and at the corner of the hawker center closest to bus terminal there is a simple table with a mound of pink rice noodle topped with mint, basil and a special zesty sauce. It has a fresh, earthy Thai-Style flavor that is very seductive.f) Gurney Rojak--sets up at about 7pm. Opposite the Kerabu Beehoon, the uncle has mind-bending knife skills. He serves us a fierce Rojak (stinky fruit salad that has alternating  sweet, tangy, hot, fishy flavors. The fruit and vegetables have similarly contrasting squishy, crunchy and crispy bits). This is to date my favorite example of the signature Penang Rojak.g) Steamed Bun Stall--amble to the next corner with the Chinese Temple on the left, and you cannot miss this stall. All the buns have a FLUFFY, yeast roll scent. I love the BBQ Pork, Red Bean and Lotus Paste buns. They also have Siew Mai (prawn dumplings) and Lo Mai Kai--will try that next and report.h) Tapioca Chips RM5--from the Steamed bun stall, this place is just 10m towards the dumpsters, on the right. the Tapioca Chips look just like potato crisps but are more resilient. Great for dips and baked casseroles.i) Lor Bak Stall--walk another 5m little further down from the Tapioca Chip stall and you will see the Lor Bak stall on the left. I skip the mayonnaise and just dip the mildly flavored 5 spice rolls in the chili sauce.j) Hakka Yong Tau Foo--a few meters towards the dumpsters and on the right, opposite the Seafood Char Kway Kak. The uncle sells his assortment of fish balls, fish cake, meat balls and stuffed tofu with a sweet fermented bean sauce and fiery chili sauce. RM3 for a simple assortment of about 8 pieces (?). He is not always there, but I look for him each time.k) Kachang Puteh (assorted freid peas, beans, nuts)--the next stall on the left just before the dumpsters sells muruku (lentil flour snacks spiced with curry powder), steamed chick peas (garbanzo beans) and fried broad beans, peanuts, chick peas, peas, etc. My favorite are the fried vada (lentil balls)--both kinds 3 for RM2. One looks like a tiny golden brown bagel/doughnut and the other a dark brown coarse lentil ball.l) Fruit Stalls--round the corner from the dumpsters are the 2 fruit stalls that consistently sells some of the best apples, oranges, plums and other fruit (at prices lower than cold Storage). I particularly like the Pink Lady Apples and little California Oranges. Frequent these stalls regularly and the owners will make honest recommendations about fruit that are particularly good.m) PUBLIC RESTROOMSThey exist at this market, but are perpetually wet and are often smelly.

I started early in the morning (7:30) because I had only limited time for trekking and also wanted to avoid crowds. The trail was easy with a few very steep parts - take good shoes, no flip-flops. It took cca 75 min to go there (I am average but experienced trekker), the way back was much faster - cca 60 min. But during going back I met hundreds of tourists in the opposite directions and had to often wait until big groups (20-30 people) pass by due to narrow paths. I was lucky that I started early in the morning and was almost alone on the beach. The weekend is not a good time for visiting this park - the crowds of tourists may negatively influence your experience. But the beach is nice and trekking in the jungle is very good experience.

To get there you could take a boat or  hike there, about a 1.5 hour hike, on a well-marked trail though difficult in places. We discovered this place by mistake because the place we wanted to visit was actually Monkey Beach but on that day the trail to reach it was closed due to a landslide. The park opens at 8 am and entrance to the park is free. Bring your own water as Turtle beach is a conservation area so there are no vendors there (thank goodness). If you wear proper walking shoes the walk is pleasant and manageable. You are walking through the forests so it's shady for the most part. When you reach the last 20 minutes of the trail you have the option of taking the shorter but steeper drop to the beach or the gentler path that goes behind the Mecromitic Lake and parallel to the beach. So take the gentler track on the return trip if you are walking back. If you choose to take a boat back to the park entrance, do book the boat before you set off on your track. The boat fare is about 90Rm per boat (not per passenger) per trip. Of course, we walked back.  Please bring your trash out with you.No swimming is allowed on the beach. There is a small turtle sanctuary (nothing to shout about).

Due to the landslides some parts of the walkways or bridges were quite touch to cross (missing wooden steps etc) but overall rather easy to manage. The entire park could do with some better maintenance as there were missing steps all throughout, not just within the 'closed' trail. Visitors should be charged at least a symbolic USD 1-2 to help them with this. Ayway, the Monkey Beach was fantastic - easy to swim with beautiful sand and surroundings.

Now I like Monkeys, they remind me of very naughty children and Monkey beach was full of them. We sat in a shack that served cold beer and coconuts we had one of each and within seconds we had a gang of little mischievous monkey friends. A firm grip was required on the coconut as naughty monkeys would remove it from you possession in the blink of an eye.  Afer an hour our captain appeared and it was another high speed bumming back to the pier of death, it is worth noting that parts of his boat fell of during the trip and piecies of metal bounced in the bottom of the boat as we skimmed the sea.

But the way in which these closures were handled seems poor at best - as some other reviewers suspect, it may even be a scam to goad tourists into taking an overpriced boat ride to a non-existent""island"". According to the signs announcing the closure, this information is posted on the official Penang National Park website. This surprised me, given that I'd spent quite a bit of time researching trail maps, the registration procedure etc. in advance, and hadn't seen anything mentioning closures. As it turned out, the official-looking website I had assumed was the Penang National Park site was not at all. TripAdvisor won't let me share the official web address (even though it's a governmental, not commercial site) but it has ""wildlife"" in the URL and is not exactly obvious, nor something that pops up immediately when you do a search (at least in English). As it turns out though, visiting the correct site made little difference. On the mobile site, I couldn't find a way to access an English version, but neither did there seem to be any obvious notices of closures in Malay. At home, I checked the desktop version, and lo and behold, there is English available if you click the little UK flag at the top. Then, if you select ""Penang National Park"" from the ""Public"" menu, you will be taken to an information page... which doesn't mention the Monkey Beach trail closure at all. There is no notice next to the hiking activites. The only closure listed is a note that the canopy walkway is ""temporarily closed for maintenance"", but given the URL suggests this page was created in 2016, and it doesn't seem to have been updated since, it appears that ""temporarily"" might mean three years or more! Clearly a better job could be done of alerting visitors to these closures before they make the trip to the park. But other reviewers have voiced their suspicions that the closures (and their poor communication) may be a scam to goad tourists into taking the expensive boat rides to ""Monkey Island"", the deceptive name given to a stretch of beach further up the coast more properly known as Monkey Beach. Monkey Beach is surrounded by the National Park but is itself privately owned. The theory is that once tourists have arrived after a long bus trip or expensive taxi ride and discover they have no other option than to take a boat ride because the trail is closed or because they're told it's an island, they'll pay whatever is demanded. After seeing for myself what little effort has been made to alert tourists to these closures before they arrive, and after so long, I share some of these suspicions. It's notable that the Penang Tourist Map, produced by the State Tourism Board, marks the State Museum with three red asterisks and informs visitors that it ""is closed for 3 years from 2017"", but not only is no such warning given for Teluk Duyung (Monkey Beach), it actually promises ""Take on the nature trails and hike all the way up to the pristine beaches of Teluk Duyung, Muka Head, or Pantau Kerachut"" which is not possible, and hasn't been since 2017. Why is the museum's closure (from the same year) communicated to visitors, but not the beach's? A lack of communication or deliberate obfuscation seem to be the only possibilities.As disappointing and suspicious as all of this is, tourists who want to experience nature and see some wildlife should not lose hope - the national park, despite the rubbish other reviewers have mentioned (tires, diapers, bottles and cans) is a beautiful place, and you can still have a pleasant walk to USM CEMAC/Teluk Aling (around 2km/40min from the entrance) even if it's not the full hike to the Monkey Beach/Teluk Duyung (which is 3.4km/1.15hr from the entrance).Entrance to the National Park is free, your only obligation is to register before entering (this appears to be solely for data gathering purposes - there was nobody in the booth to check our permit on entry, and  you aren't requested to sign out, so it doesn't seem to be for safety reasons.)Just inside the park is a small beach on which you can see monkeys after just a short walk (around 15min). Check this area before agreeing to an expensive boat ride (past reviewers have said they paid up to 100RM per person, one way, which is the equivalent of $70AUD for a round trip - extremely pricey for what is a very short boat ride, and especially so when you consider the reports of people paying 100RM for a private boat at the entrance, only to have the captain pick up others along the way for only 10RM each.)You may just find you can bypass the expense and the long trek by visiting this much closer, less spoiled beach.",Dec 2019,December 2019,Couples

My suggestion is to do most of your exploration by foot and skip the expensive speed boats -- including giving Monkey Beach a miss and avoiding the turtle sanctuary unless you call ahead and make sure that it is turtle season indeed and that turtles will show up to the party.

This over ambitious unplanned mission to go to the end of the earth to discover a small beach with no one there and for you to claim it all didn’t come easy. It is tough going up and down and up and down on very many steep slopes. My Apple watch told me that i took about 100 minutes to walk 5 km from entrance to kampi. There were many fallen trees and many broken bridges,  paths , ropes and many years of neglect. Signage was very poor: overall about 3 signs. If you are stuck in there, you are gone. No one will find you.! a litre of water is not enough but you have to carry it: at least 2L. I hike weekly up down 800m+ in about 30 mins last 4 years and walk 5 km daily in preparation for mission like this. It has helped heaps and to kampi you need to train. Nothing is at kampi so you need to bring food (I brought a roast chicken, tomatoes lettuce and 1L water: not enough for 5 June trip. You should bring bread and light food). You need towel, change of clothes: basically a 4-5 kilo backpack. I sweated like a pig. Finally reaching the beach it was s relieve. The beach was small nice , a little different with a coconut tree and totally secluded. Australia has nicer beaches you can get to in minutes of walking. Kampi is too hard and too far to get to and is for the hardcore and misguided travelers like me. I thought of taking the boat back. It came only to deliver food to the 2 guys who were on duty. I spoke to them (they were surprised to see me and one first asked me how old I was and I said 53 and he seemed shocked: what? Haven’t seen a 53 year man do this? Apparently not. What ? so I was the first? No one this crazy I think it’s what they were thinking. Engrave my name in stone mate.) they told me that were rostered there for a week and a boat would take them back at the end of roster. They also said no one has been there for some time. When the boat came I asked the owner for a trip back and he wanted $35 ringgit which I thought was a ripoff so didn’t take it and decided to walk back. I didn’t know you had took your boat at the entrance before hand if you wanted to be picked up. (At the entrance later I found out that booking a boat was $100 per boat for max 5: regardless of person). Big mistake for now only because I Made a bad turn and went a wrong way. Told you signage was bad and I was 2 km and at least 50 mins out by the time I realised and turned back.? Total back trip was 2 hours 13 mins back with cramps and nothing left in reserved. Took a cold shower with shots and shoes on. Barely standing. Thinking of troops in jungle warfare mid way back. Very tough going not for anyone above 40 lol. This is not turtle beach. Kampi trip is in a different league. It’s a trip you really want to get lost because you are so mad and you need to channel all that madness into hiking energy. Go early back before 6 to recover. Done get lost like I did. It’s scary. No internet no communication no one there to rescue you. You run of water bad luck.no one will know or find you unless you had told someone before hand but if you got lost, then pray. Never hike alone to kampi.",Jun 2019,June 2019,Solo

If you are someone who loves beaches, loves to try out new things and wants to have a mild check, you really MUST visit this place ❤️ it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. To begin with, this is a trekking trail along the beach front. You needn’t necessarily trek, you may choose to go boating as well. There are two beaches along the shoreline - monkey beach and Kerachut beach. Unless you find it really hard to walk or are too tired, I would highly recommend that you take the trail. Ensure that you are wearing good shoes and carry water with you. After the initial five mins, you will encounter jungle trail - i.e there would no flat surface to walk upon, it is uneven walking plane with lot of stones, roots and other items along the way. But all this is an amazing experience and the beach along the walkway is secluded more often than not and you can get some really wonderful pictures ❤️ we couldn’t finish our trek to the monkey beach as the trail was shut due to storm, but we did manage to go part of the way and we were mind blown! ❤️❤️❤️🙌🏻 this is a free trail.

Upon arrival there are stands where local boat companies are selling tickets to take you to different islands. You do not NEED to take a boat to get to the islands and you can hike to them through the park instead. We had planned to hike to Turtle Beach and had intention on camping there. The lady at the boat told us that in order to camp at Turtle Beach we needed a guide, so she suggested we hike there and then take a boat to Monkey Beach for camping, to avoid having a guide. The hike to Turtle Beach was about 1 hour, maybe a little less, and wasn’t very difficult. When we arrived there, it was pretty empty and for a couple hours we were the only foreigners on the island. At Turtle Beach you are not permitted to swim in the water and the sanctuary was closed in February, so we didn’t get to see turtles. The beach was absolutely beautiful and and we even saw a sea lion swimming and rolling around on the beach near us. After a few hours the boat we arranged to pick us up showed up at the dock and took us to Monkey Island. The boat ride was 100RM which gave us a boat to ourselves, but that was because we paid at the entrance of the park. I would suggest waiting at the island and then paying the driver when you want to leave because others that got on the boat only paid 10RM, since they were sharing our boat (the money went to the driver). Planning ahead is not necessary to take a boat to Monkey Beach from Turtle Beach, and you can hike in between them easily if you don’t want to take a boat. Monkey Beach was not as beautiful and secluded as Turtle Beach. There were quite a few locals renting tents, selling drinks, and food during the daytime. The beach was not as clean but still nice to relax. You can pay to rent a tent there or you can pitch your own tent free of charge. We had our camping equipment so we decided to do the latter. Sleeping on the beach was an event in itself. The waves were loud and big during the night and there were plenty of little creatures moving around near us. There were also LOTS of mosquitoes. Overall it was a good camping experience, just be prepared for heat, mosquitoes, and creatures roaming near your tent at night. The following day we relaxed on some lounge chairs and swam in the water to cool down from the heat. The boat driver picked us up from Monkey Beach and took us back to the pier. Again, I recommend just paying a driver at the beach instead of planning ahead, unless you have a group larger than five, because there are loads of boats coming and going all day to take you back.

As with many places of worship, we were asked to cover our exposed body and hair if we wanted to enter the Prayers Hall, and clothes and scarves were provided free of charge. Otherwise, if we were not agreeable to the dress code, we were allowed to walk outside the Prayers Hall and take photographs. We were given a free guided tour for around half an hour, during which we learnt more about the architecture and history of the mosque as well as beliefs and practices of Islam. It was an insightful tour and we were never made to feel uncomfortable even though we had different ethnic and religious backgrounds. There was also a rack of informative brochures.

Also be sure to go inside and see the ""quite-magnificent"" domed ceiling with these four-sided shapes (like diamonds or something, kind of interesting to me), and there's also an upper gallery above although I believe it's off-limits to the public; and they do provide some clothing piece for those wearing shorts to go inside, so it's ok if you don't come wearing long pants.  Overall, this is a worthwhile mosque to visit (for its tranquillity by the sea & the beautiful domed ceiling inside as mentioned above) although it may not be as convenient to get to (depending on where you're staying) as Kapitan Keling Mosque in the George Town heritage area.Coming by bus, the 101 & 102 buses stop pretty much right in front of the Mosque (across the street if you're coming from the direction of George Town and going toward Batu Ferringhi); or if you're staying at hotels like Flamingo and Copthorne Orchid, it's just about a half-hour walk to here from those places (turn right after coming out of those places and just go straight on that road).",Apr 2017,July 2016,Solo

That was the first time I learnt the term `floating mosque'. In my mind, I was then visualizing that the mosque was floating on the sea. I wonder if the mosque really float in the sea? I was excited to find out how maritime technology is so advanced as to make a mosque float in the sea. Along the way to the mosque, I bypassed a restaurant located just opposite the mosque at the same side of my friend's condo. I was attracted by the number of patrons queuing for breakfast there and I joined in the queue to have my nasi lemak. It was terriffic good and reasonably cheap. I love this traditional food here. The mosque is located near a bend and the traffic at the bend was not light. You have to be careful crossing the road from the condo to the mosque. There is a free car park for vehicles to park just at the front of the mosque. You are free to roam around outside the prayer hall and I like the sea scenery here. You can see sampans moored at the sea and feel the cool sea winds blowing on your face as you gazed towards the vast horizon. The beach further down the road at the extreme right of the mosque was once hit by the dreadful tsunami. There were two blocks of flats located just next to the mosque that were constructed for the victims of the tsunami. As I looked at the few isolated fishing sampans that laid unattended at the quiet beach in front of the blocks of flats, my thoughts went philosphical. We are so fragile a creature on this vast land, many events are unpredictable and life could just be destroyed and diminished within split second of a disaster. I heard from someone that this floating mosque was spared unscathed during the disaster and pondered how it had witnessed the bitter suffering of those who perished in the dreadful torrential waves. I realized that the mosque was not floating without a foundation. It has a strong solid piling that anchor it deep into the sea bed of Penang. While it faces the sea, its beauty lies with the people of the Land and with its continual blessing to this wonderful island and people of Penang.",Jul 2014,February 2014,Friends

It is open even though the surrounding hotel is still being worked on.  Teddyville is an excellent place for young children, especially those of an age to still find teddies wonderful.By the entrance to Teddyville is an enormous teddy, maybe 8 foot high.  It is an incredibly cuddly bear and the kind of thing a toddler will love giving a big hug to.The entrance fee is pretty reasonable, this is not an expensive place to visit.Inside the museum, most of the exhibits showcase Penang culture and history.  It is a great introduction to Penang regardless of having teddies.  The teddies are posed around key features of the island and moments in its history.  There are around ten different scenes depicted and each of them tells the story excellently backed up by good signage explaining what is being shown.The teddies themselves are in great condition and are really nice to see.  They are posed really well to give a feel of a real environment.  Key people are also depicted in teddy form.  Naturally the likeness is entirely missing but it is still a fun way to showcase a bit of historical knowledge.The first room is a bit different from the rest.  It contains teddies from history including Stieff bears and other notable stuffed toys.  This is more a room for adults to see than for kids but it is nice to see reminders of teddies from previous generations such as Teddy Ruxpin.The shop is a little disappointing and somewhat overpriced.  The biggest downside at the moment is that the hotel Teddyville is situated within is not open.  Getting in and out is hassle.  It involves walking past what is not much beyond a building site.  On top of this the bridge to the other side of the road on a busy street is closed and the bus stop on the other side does not appear to slow down passing buses.

Artfully hung LED lights trail from branches of huge trees, with the trees itself sporting different hues of colour to contrast with the branches- resulting in a 'solar eclipse' look for certain trees. Rest shacks are generously found throughout the gardens with very comfortable wooden benches- you will need these if you intend to explore the whole park. The floor is also alight with fluorescent flowers, while various statues (cobra statue, Chinese Gods statues etc.) can be spotted once you have shifted attention away from the trees to look at the garden as a whole. Hawker food is abundant as well.The only and biggest downside of this attraction is the difficulty in reaching this place. It is a very underdeveloped area and it is NOT easy at all to get Uber drivers in this remote location (forget taxis). If you are driving, there is also very limited parking spots as, besides the temple car park, the rest of the place is a residential area where parking is not allowed.
