We were concerned and contacted the front desk. Staff was not able to resolve the issue hence they did a room change for us.The second room that we had was clean and had no cleanliness issue.Overall great service and action from the staff. But housekeeping work is to be improved.,Nov 2018,November 2018,Families

RM100 for a queen size bed is about alright for me, although no small fridge or free coffee/tea sachets available. Cant complain much. Location wise is good as very nearby to the vibrant Kampar new township with many shops and restaurants. This hotel has good potential to be an even better hotel than it is now.",Jul 2019,July 2019,Solo

Hotel room is big, clean and surprisingly quite (as I came out from the lift I hear children crying but when I when in to the room there are no crying sound - which is a plus point). But one would need to drive out for food as there are no restaurant nearby. Nonetheless, it only take bout 1KM drive to nearby KFC/McD and other F&B shop. There is only 1 complaint (if there is any) as the front desk only officially open from 7am-7pm, to go in & out of the hotel will be a little bit troublesome. They indicate that the room access card can open the front door but its not working. Nonetheless, they have a worker around the lobby area so you need to press the bell & hope that the staff is around to open the door for you.",Mar 2019,March 2019,Solo

It's a nice hotel, with full amnesties. Just that, if you stayed in the one in the Kampar town center, the parking is a bit problematic because it's next to a cinema, so, the parking is always full thus you have to park further away from the hotel building, perhaps on the next 1 or 2 blocks.",Sep 2018,June 2018,None
