Initially I had requested to check in early, but due to work commitment, I had to check in after 6pm. Did a last minute call to inform and the staff, Amir was pleasantly helpful with it. Checking in process was a breeze, as well for my entire stay there. Though I mostly had to return back late after 9 or 10 pm, the night shift colleague on duty was friendly and helpful as well when I requested for assistance. The hotel is pretty much secured, after 11pm only residence with key card could enter, that makes me feel ensured as I'm staying alone although my business partner would drop by to check on me. Last but not least, thank you to Amir and the manager on duty(sorry didn't get his name) for assisting me when I had to request for a last minute extension of my stay even though the rooms were almost fully booked for the weekends.

Growing up in a small town isn’t easy. Ever since I’ve move out from Kampar when I was very young, I’ve been expose to many Boutique hotels especially luxury ones and lately I’m into those chic hotels. It’s only a night stay here and I book myself the suite instead of the standard rooms. This isn’t my first stay with M Boutique, and actually we check out from Station 18 then checking into Kampar. The suite in Kampar has a more modern interior but different. I like the design, but there are so much more the management can do. For example, there’s two bedside table - why only put one lamp? There’s an empty corner - why not a standing lamp? There’s a nice long couch - why not a coffee table? :-) Upon check in, as usual I had to check all corners of the room. The room was filthy. Covered with dust, hairs on the floor, bathroom tiles were oily and the room safe isn’t working. I’m guessing the Hotel is running low of staff so I ask the lady from the reception to come up and I showed her the dusty shelves and dirty floor. We went out for lunch afterwards but room was clean at the end in the evening which is good. Room safe isn’t working still though. Would I come back again, yes. My guess the room had low occupancy and no one had stay for a period of time because it’s “Kampar”. But rooms should be inspect before any guest check in, this is still a fairly new hotel. Next time, do inspect the rooms first. Friends stayed at the standard rooms and it was decent as well. No windows, but the bathroom idea was genius.",Dec 2017,December 2017,Solo

Both the ambience and design of the hotel was really cool. It was hipster, new and interesting. However, the horrible service made me severely sad. I booked this hotel via agoda and thus, even before arriving I have already paid for my hotel. Common sense states that, I don't owe this hotel a single cent anymore. Thus, when I arrived at the hotel, I was surprised to find that I had to pay a deposit of RM100 which was refundable. I have nothing against this policy. However, I was shocked that I have to do that. Because as a person who have paid everything, one would expect zero cash transaction.I been to many other hotels and although they have this policy, they just charged on my credit card after asking for my permission. I find that still alright because atleast no real cash transaction happened. What if I had no cash in my hand for the hotel? Some hotels even outright no longer have this sort of policies.I just wished I was told before I arrived. Be it in an email or a notice. Just a heads up so I can prepare myself. The staff that told me about this was very rude. I was tired from my trip so I didn't want to argue or anything but I was certainly pissed.I noticed a writing at the front door that they close it after 11pm and you will require your room card to enter, thus I asked for one as I only have one. I intended to go to a cafe later while my family wanted to stay in and watched tv. The staff rudely told me that there isn't any extra card and that the front desk would be open. I disliked her rude attitude, so I decided not to go to a cafe and just stayed in. I am absolutely appalled with the service here. The beautiful hotel could have been a very pleasant trip had it not been for the bad service. To be honest, I really love the decor and ambience here.What a waste.",Nov 2017,November 2017,Families

Booked for 1 week with price MYR 200++ / night. Expected good services and others. But, these what I found: 1. Aircond sounds so loud. Cannot sleep. 2. Portable water heater not functioning. 3. No amenities such toothbrush, shampoo, slipper, etc. 4. No iron in room. Need to walk very far to iron my shirt. 5. Not complete laundry sheet. I cannot send laundry next day. 6. No duty manager at night. I call everyone, no pick up. 7. Wifi not functioning. After connected, very slow. Cannot watch youtube or open facebook. Only can use whatsapp or other mesaging apps. 8. Not friendly receptionist. I talked to them on the issues, then they replied why no call yesterday so that they will fix the problem instead of suggesting changing room or fix the problem straight away. So I talked to the receptionist to cancel my booking from second day until end of booking. And they said cannot since I have paid for them. As I remembered, we can cancel the booking although we have paid, only the repayment back will be a little bit longer due to processes of cancelling via credit card. So I have lodged a report to cancel the booking. But at night I called again, and the receptionist (working at night) said she didnt know about the issue. Here are some of the item that you may find troubling also: 1. tv not good. small and not clear. 2. the area is not good. free parking but you need to get here fast due to crowded people roaming the mall. So exclusive parking for hotel eventhough there are few spots said ""reserve for hotel"". 3. Room is clean but feel like cheap hotel. Upgraded lodge type hotel. 4. Very small bathroom. Crowded design. All in all, I would like to recommed everyone to not come to this hotel. Not worth for money. If you want to find place to sleep and to take shower only, yes it is okay.

I can understand if she's new, but I don't know that it was hard for her to give a friendly and honest smile. The other staff, the senior colleague I supposed, also 2x5 with her. 2. Our deluxe room priced at rm200. Rm30 extra to compare if we booked earlier via online. The room located at level 7. It was spacey,they use open wardrobe, with safety box, kettle. But got no icebox. The odd part was looking for the room slipper when your bare foot can't stand the cold tiles. (No carpet). 3. Putting a piece of paper and pensil definately useful, especially for those who stays on business travel. In case they need to jot down anything. The hotel amenities was below basic for that kind of price. 4. Bathroom is ok. Just fit the purpose. Got hairdryer. 5. Complimentary breakfast available at level 4. The meals variation were so so. Pool was located next to cafe area. The design was decent though.6.The location is good. Attached to bilion supermarket and cinema.5minutes from UTP. 7.

The biggest hotel in Seri Iskandar with buffet breakfast2. Modern room and new3. Ironing facilities is provided at each floor4. Decent location. Next to shopping mall and shops5. The shower is goodCons:1. Staffs at the front desk are not friendly and no smile. This is the first time I check in without receiving any welcome greeting. 2. Staffs front desk not attentive and inefficient. The check in process was facing difficulty because the system is offline / not stable. But the front desk staff just keep their doing work without informing me the current situation. Make me waiting and wondering why my check in process took so long. I also was not informed about the breakfast (the time and venue). Did they expect me to figure it out by myself?  I saw her tag as 'trainee' but the management should ensure each staff is properly trained especially a new staff. 3. Room cleanliness is fair. But I found the towel has strong smell of bleaching agent (eg:clorox).4. No fridge in standard room. 5. The standard room is tiled with marble but no slipper is provided. 6. Internet connection only available at the lobby and not in the room. The internet at the lobby also not stable and keep disconnected. not as what they claim 'hi-speed internet access. I was there for my business trip, so internet connection is indeed very important to me. 7. The security / staff in front of the hotel also not nice, not friendly and not helpful. Only stand there like a statue without any courage to assist me to remove the signboard when I was about to park my car in front of the hotel. Then, I was carrying a few big and heavy bags, but none of the staff has any courage to offer a hand.  8. The buffet breakfast spread is just fair. Not much choice & not tasty. They serve nasi lemak without cucumber & nuts (funny...incomplete nasi lemak). Overall, I'm quite disappointed with my experience staying at this hotel.

The corridor is narrow and gloomy although it has the quirky and nostalgic elements. When we first enter the room, I found foul smells, most likely caused by bad ventilation as there was only 1 window and it was closed.  The wall is not so sound-proof, so it will be slightly noisy during night time.However, the rooms is equipped with basic amenities, air-conditioned, and with a decent size of toilet cum shower room. They even provide us clean towels, and there’s a water cooler system just few steps away from our room. That’s a big plus. There is also designated parking space just outside the hotel. The main plus point is its great location, very near to AEON mall (formerly known as Jaya Jusco) and Tesco hypermarket. However, the hotel is slightly far from Ipoh town (around 30 minutes drive), shouldn’t be a problem for those who own/rent a car. There is a hawker center just next door the hotel.

Since this was the holiday season, there wasn't much choice so I went for this Hotel (Hotel Station 18), and based on the pleasant reviews on Tripadvisor as well the Recommended hotel award. However, how WRONG I was to think so.The check-in process was smooth, however the receptionist did not smile or greet us (me and my wife). After checking in, we thought we'd have a shower after the long journey, and to our EXTREME DISPLEASURE there was NO hot water in the shower !. I thought I didn't switch on something, so I called the receptionist and after a few minutes was told that their water heater system relied on Solar power, and since it has been raining for the past few days there was insufficient sunlight to produce any hot water. WOW. This was the most AMAZING answer I've ever heard. No sunlight, we cannot do anything. SUPERB!. Solar supported systems are two way (ie. conventional with electricity supply or solar), but they were RELUCTANT to use ELECTRICITY for the guest convenience! JUST TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS ON THE ELECTRICITY BILL. The receptionist told me she couldn't do anything, I that was it. Then there's another shock. The FLUSH was not working!. Again I called to receptionist, and I was told THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING AS ALL THE OTHER ROOMS WERE FULL!!! I can't believe this. No hot water and the flush wasn't working. Which means their washrooms were FULLY DYSFUNCTIONAL. HOW AMAZING. For a TripAdvisor recommended hotel.Throughout our ordeal, no apologies or any sort of compensation for our EXTREME DISCOMFORT. Instead we were told this is a budget hotel (RM100 is NOT a budget hotel for Malaysian standards).DO NOT stay in this hotel. I'd rather you stay in a backpacker's. If someone from the management is reading this, if you have any remorse, PLEASE contact me for any sort of compensation if you have any shame.If someone from Tripadvisor is reading this, PLEASE  remove their recommended hotel rating.

The room that we booked was Deluxe Double Room. Other than my experience staying at the hotel, I would also like to share my unpleasant booking experience here. I made room reservation 3 months before the check-in-date via booking.com. At that time, free cancellation was allowed BEFORE NOVEMBER 2014 (just a few days before checking in). It was also written in booking.com that YOU WILL PAY WHEN YOU STAY AT HOTEL STATION 18. However, about 2 weeks before checking in, I received an email from the hotel, asking me to make full payment within 1 week time or else my room reservation will be cancelled. I was also asked send bank in slip to them once the payment had been made. I called them for verification purpose and I was told just to reply their email. Then, I requested in the email to make the payment only upon checking in but it was rejected due to the ridiculous hotel policy that whenever the number of reservation reaches 50%, full advanced payment is needed to confirm the reservations! At the end, I had no choice but to make the payment because I had already planned my trip (e.g. places to visit and routes to be followed) 2 months ahead. Since it was written in booking.com that TOTAL ROOM PRICE: RM106 and TAX (6%) NOT INCLUDED, I transferred RM112.36 to the hotel. Surprisingly, the hotel replied me the next day, informed me that the total room rate was only RM106 and they would refund the extra RM6.36 to me. Then, I replied to them what was written in booking.com and what I got was a similar message without any explanation. When I read back the first email sent to me, then only I realized the RM106 was inclusive of the 6% tax. Thank so much for creating so many inconsistencies between the information provided by the hotel and booking.com.On the check-in-day afternoon at 4:14pm, I received a call from the hotel again, asking me whether I still wanted to check in that day. I told her full payment had already been made 1 week ago. Then, she asked me to bring along the bank in slip. I told her that wouldn’t be necessary, what I needed to bring along with me is the booking.com ticket only which I had printed long time ago. The reason is that since I had already made the payment, and sent the bank in slip to them, why would I have to do it again? She can just enter my name into the system and search for my payment record. However, she didn’t listen to my explanation but insisted, asking me to bring along the bank in slip. This was my first experience with a hotel that tried to make itself convenient by causing inconvenience to its guests. Thumbs down to hotel!       On the same day, my girlfriend and I used Waze to guide us to the hotel. By the time we reached the “destination”, it was about 2:30am already. However, we couldn’t find the hotel. After spending some time exploring the area, then only we managed to find the hotel which is nearby to the location provided by Waze. The car parks in front of the hotel are limited. They were almost full but we were lucky enough to find one, right in front of the hotel :) However, we were unable to find one at the second night and therefore we had to park our car at the roadside :( Luckily, it is free of charge. For those who are afraid of dogs, you have to beware of the dogs at the entrance of the hotel because the moment we got out from our car, we were welcomed by a barking dog. Luckily, it only barked but it didn’t jump onto us and bite us. There was a security guard stationed at the entrance of the hotel. Due to the reason that the area was very quiet especially at night, his presence made us feel a little bit safer.Since our trip was a long trip, we had many luggage: 2 huge luggage, 2 medium-sized luggage, 1 small luggage, 1 laptop bag and 1 handbag. The time we unloaded our luggage from our car and carried them into the hotel lobby, the security guard didn’t offer any help. Upon checked in, a deposit of RM50 was required. After checking in and getting the key from the receptionist (who never smiled), we had difficulties carrying our luggage to our room as there was no lift in the hotel! We had no choice but to carry our luggage up to the first floor using the only stairs. The worst thing is the receptionist (a guy) didn’t offer any help again! Thumbs down to the unwelcoming and unhelpful staffs. Also thumbs down to the hotel for creating so many bad first impressions. It is kind of hard to believe that such as hotel could be rated as no. 5 in Tripadvisor.The room was quite big and it was clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable to sleep. The blanket was thick enough to provide us a comfortable and warm night sleep. There was a dressing table and mirror right beside the bed which was big enough for me to do my office work at night. There were also sufficient clothes hangers and wall hooks in the room. The room was provided with 2 bottles of drinking water. Although they were not replenished daily, water dispenser was available around the stairs area. Wi-Fi speed was inconsistent as my girlfriend had problem watching online video. TV had a number of channels with good reception. Its Air-Cond was cold. The room was quite quiet the 3 days 2 nights I was there. We didn't hear any sound from the outside of the hotel we could people talking at the corridor from the room. So, I guess the room was not really soundproof. Water dispenser was not available in the hotel. The bathroom was spacious and clean. It has a rain shower but the shower pressure was average only. We used the 2 towels provided as they looked clean and smelled fresh. Toiletries (e.g. 3-in-1 bath gel) provided were sufficient. I must not forget to mention that the location of the hotel is very strategic as it is surrounded by 2 hypermarkets (e.g. AEON Jusco and Tesco) within talking distance and there is a cinema in the AEON Jusco. There is also a Chinese restaurant right beside the hotel but it only has limited stalls and it only operates at night. Overall, we were not satisfied with the booking experience only and the not so friendly attitude of the staffs – never volunteer to help and never smile at guests. In spite of that, considering its good location, nice room with decent facilities and the cheap price we paid for our room (RM53 per night), it is definitely still worth it.",Dec 2014,December 2014,Couples

Also, although they have limited TV channels (yes, they have a LED TV in every room!), the stations were properly tuned.On top of that, they have sufficient power supply points just next to the bed, above the bedside table, which made charging mobiles and other electrical items very convenient.

Also, when the room next door used the shower, the plumbing works caused a loud whining noise in the room.

He could have nicely informed us that the pub next to it need to use it and we should park outside. Instead, he just shouted at us as if we knew it and purposely bump into that area. Checked in was fast. Our room at level 1 which was accessible via staircase just next to the reception. However, the staircase door seem like an office door and locked so we a bit hesitate to take it instead we took another longer way up. The front counter staff didn't correct us. We found out the door actually is not locked when we reached level 1.Water cooler was available at level 1 common place. Reasonable room space for the price we paid. Room is clean.

Upon arrival, my girlfriend and I were greeted by sniggers from the manageress and one of her staff, amused I'm sure by the appearance of two white people. Despite my best efforts to initiate the usually obligatory exchange of pleasantries, I was stonewalled by the ignorant staff, while they chatted in Malay, until the manageress quoted us the price (tax, of course, to be added) and began the arduous process of listing a whole ream of stern rules. I had never heard anything of its ilk! Shocked and disheartened, I trundled off to my room for a nice shower. It was a hot day and had been a long bus journey, followed by a 35RM (!!!!!!!) taxi ride from the bus station to this most inconveniently located hotel. I turned on the shower and was almost frozen to a solid block by the water that came out. Despite my complaints, this remained the case throughout our stay. After a trip out for dinner, I was just about ready for bed, what horror when I realised the blanket was a raggy old towel and the sheets were covered in cigarette burns and pink stains (I'm none the wiser, either).The next day, we went to rent a motorcycle. We were told we would have to lay down a deposit, by credit card, for 1000 (yes, ONE THOUSAND) ringgit. Luckily, my girlfriend had her international credit card on her person, by pure chance. This was quite a turn of fortune, as they refused to accept our passports (the standard deposit system). It is dubious as to whether this transaction has actually been cancelled, as we were told the manageress was unavailable throughout the two hours before we had to leave for our next bus. (Actually, I could see her milling around with the poor pet dog that she keeps chained up inside the hotel all day. I suppose walking it up and down the dingy corridors counts for its daily exercise.) Needless to say, my girlfriend will be checking her statements, as the bike was returned in exactly the same condition as when we rented it.When we rented the bike, we envisaged escapades of joy and marvel around Ipoh, not solely from our own imaginations but, indeed, from the mystical Ian's! Anyone who looks on the hotel's website will see a whole itinerary of activities for the day. This includes such wonders as the Ipoh Halong Bay and the Mirror Lake. When we asked whether they had any maps or information about these sites, the response was a simple, one note, ""no"". Stunned and dismayed, we retreated for a bite to eat. I could not believe the treatment we were receiving. We returned to the reception and the manageress stared us up and down and demanded to know why we hadn't left yet. We told her we would like to know where we could get a map of the town. How on earth could we possibly navigate a town (beginning from its industrialised outskirts) to which we had never been before with no maps or guidance? She replied that we would have to drive into the town centre to tourist information. ""It's down the road, turn left and straight on."" This resulted in a great deal of aimless driving and having to ask a great number of different locals for help. I can only be thankful that virtually everybody else we have met in Malaysia has been amongst the most hospitable people I can conceive of, including those who eventually pointed us in the right direction.When we finally arrived at the tourist information centre, an hour and a half later, we showed the extremely friendly assistant a list of the recommended places on Ian's website. He had not heard of ANY of them, except Kellie's Castle and the Cave Temple. Thank heavens that he had an alternative itinerary for us to follow. Having already paid an extortionate amount to get from the bus station to the hotel, we were witlessly optimistic that, like the reviews on this site, we may be given a ride to the station when we departed. Oh good heavens, how wrong we were! Not only would they not help us to book a ticket to Penang, the woman at reception would not even find out bus times for us. When we asked the manageress for directions to go there and buy a ticket for ourselves, she again gave us the vaguest of directions. In fact, the name of the bus station she gave us was wrong! We were duly informed that it ceased operations some months ago. As you can imagine, this wasted even more of our day, as we had to make the 50km round trip by motorbike to purchase tickets for the next day.There's more besides! That evening, we sat down for dinner at the food stalls next door. It began to pour with rain and, although we had parked the motorbike under a cover, it was not fully protected. Well, motorbikes are waterproof, are they not? Apparently not! The next thing we knew, the security guard, flanked by two large Indian men, raced over asking whether we had the keys. I told him my girlfriend had them in her handbag. The two large men then scuttled over to my girlfriend, paying the friendly vendor, and demanded that she move the motorbike. I don't have any idea what their problem was, but I presume it may have something to do with the authoritarian and dictatorial management in this hotel, characterised by the ridiculous number of absurd rules and regulations all over the hotel. My girlfriend was forced out into the rain by the two men, got absolutely drenched to the skin, and then had to go upstairs for, you guessed it, a freezing cold shower.I should add that, when we arrived, we noticed the room tariffs on the website (in looking up the infamous itinerary). We paid 60RM + tax. The website specified a price of 50RM for Sun-Thurs. We stayed Mon-Wed. Make of that what you will.This hotel is perhaps the most appalling establishment I have ever had the misfortune of perusing. It is appallingly located, the service is dreadful, the shower isn't hot, the bathroom has no natural daylight and bad plumbing (resulting in horrible odours) and the room is covered in cigarette burns and stains. I got the distinct impression that we were mistreated and unwelcome in these lodgings, I just hope it wasn't, though I fear it was, due to our European heritage.As a postscript, I would like to exempt from my complaints the overall conduct of the security guard (despite his minor transgression regarding his involvement in wet-motorbike-gate), the lady on evening duty at reception who was helpful and greeted us with a smile and the old Chinese chap who runs the chicken rice stall next door.",Oct 2013,October 2013,Couples

We were lucky he was free and willing to take us out to see the many beautiful sights of Ipoh. Booking was easily done via the station 18 website, but its worth emailing to POLITELY ask if you might be able to spend some time exploring with Ian.

A helpfull tip for us was to use the SrI Maju bus company as they have a station in Ipoh centre, others will drop you along way from the centre.

We had a thorough food tour, enjoying a lot of the local delicacies!The hotel staff's services are average, but I'm giving service a full five stars as Ian really made the vacation an enjoyable one for us. I made a mistake of booking only 2 nights, and I forgot to inform Ian that I will be arriving early (way before check-in time)  and departing late (way before check-out time) as I'm travelling via coach direct from Singapore. Ian was understanding about it and assisted us with re-arranging the travel arrangements even though it was so last minute! I only realised my blunder when I called him at 5 am and boy was I glad to find him awake. He picked us up from the bus station, and settled us into a spare room for us to rest. He also helped us plan a decent itinerary involving the local sights like temple caves, Gua Tempurung, Kellie's Castle, and of course, the best local food there is. Despite still recovering from a bad flu, Ian was very accommodating throughout. Really appreciate it! We will definitely return, and we look forward to our next visit already!",Mar 2013,March 2013,Couples

He brought us to many interesting places (Kellie's Castle, Gua Tempurung, Ipoh's Biscuit Homemade Factory, Fruit Stall, Gopeng Market - where we ate delicious and cheap porridge and 'ayam pacamke').

When we entered the hotel for registration at about 5+pm, a friendly person greeted us and asked if we are free at night, as he would like to take us out for a short tour of ipoh and to introduce us to ipoh's delicacies. He was the person who was washing a car in front of the hotel that we saw when we arrived there by taxi. We were skeptical at first but soon accepted his invitation as he was a very friendly person. Then, a few hours later, at night, he showed up as promised, along with his mini cooper. It turns out that this friendly young person is the hotel's owner, he was dressed in simple manner and didn't have any sort of proudness in him. Furthermore, he always has a warm smile on his face when he's talking to us. Really humble and friendly for a boss, isn't it? I beckon that there aren't many bosses like him nowadays, you'll understand what I mean when you do meet him personally.ok, back to the story. The walkway outside the hotel room are nicely decorated with carefully selected paintings as well. There is a very unique painting beside the reception area as well, really wonderful painting, this shows that the owner has very good taste.And the room itself is very nicely decorated and comfy, with the feeling of our home, the lightings are good as well. Later on, at night, he took us to papan town for a short sightseeing, as the town is very historical, full of old buildings, there are still people living there, but many have left the area for greener pastures. After that, we went to eat some lou xu fan (cantonese), River basked in moonlight (translated from cantonese), and fried chickens. Seriously, I have never tasted these dishes before, as similar dishes from my hometown Penang, albeit with different names, simply cant compare with these. And it actually turns out that he was treating us for the meal! I can't imagine that he didnt charge us for it, for being the tour guide, transport fee (in a mini cooper some more), and the dinner fees. we felt really touched and grateful to him..Other than these places, we also visited the railway station and the courthouse which has unique designs as well.The next morning, again, he invited us to join him and another customer for breakfast, this time at a popular shop, well known for it's coffee. The parking slots are usually full, as he told us. When we reached there, turns out that it's true, but luck was on our side, where another car was leaving the parking space when we arrived. The coffee, was really delicious and the food as well, the shop, of course, full of people.Later on, he even personally sent the other customer to the bus station for free. Then, he took us to Kellie's castle, which was a gem that we would've missed if not for him, it was a nice place indeed, with nice surroundings and views. The castle has many unique designs and craftings all over. After that, we went to a museum, which looks small from the outside, but full of treasures inside! there were many unique items inside, and turns out that it was worth the trip of going there. after we're done with the museum, it was already 12+, he brought us to buy some heung beng (cantonese) before sending us to the bus station personally, again, for free!! We were truly touched and felt very lucky to have known such a nice person, who wasn't very calculative, he wasn't just concerned of gaining profits, but more towards helping others in need and making new friends, again, thanks to the owner of the hotel!It was an enjoyable stay there! Highly recommended if you were to visit ipoh, as it was a great value for money and with a friendly host.",Nov 2012,November 2012,Couples

It's a guesthouse that's run with a lot of love and care. The owner took me to places I would never have thought existed, like the ghost town of Papan, which is an eerie deserted town with old shophouses, some inhabited, many abandoned and ruinous. It isn't there in any of the guidebooks but is as interesting as any if you have even a passing interest in the history of a place. The scenery surrounding Ipoh is bucolic and life seems to go on like it always has, a rare experience in rapidly developing Malaysia. He also took me to some truly awesome places to eat, the sort of places something like the Lonely Planet would never hear about. Amazing white coffee, the best kway teow in town and some truly awesome local dishes. They went out of their way to be nice and hospitable and this is going to be ""the"" experience to beat. It's not easy to get a pulse on local life when you're backpacking but it helps when people like these help you out.I stayed in a standard room, which was quiet, clean, had a TV and an AC and cost a fraction of what it costs for such a thing in Malaysia. The toilets were shared but there were 4 of them, so there's always one when you need one. The reception works 24 hours and there's a store in the basement, so anything I needed was just a phone call away. It's a little away from the main town but it isn't so expensive to go back and forth in a taxi. It's a new developing area of Ipoh and it was interesting to live in a place that is not usually meant for ""tourists"". I highly enjoyed my experience of staying at Hotel Station 18. It was a pleasant surprise for me.",Nov 2012,November 2012,Solo

For better hotel and beside mall will be Weil hotel, but due to this hotel having a very weird policy that I don’t like, you need to pay extra if you would like to ask for extra pillow, ...... I don’t know which hotel having this kind of policy also (u all may share with me if still have any other hotel charge for extra pillow) but this will be the first one I met. Then try to surf through most of hotel but mostly having negative comment too old too smelly, not friendly, having big bite.....headache.Finally I selected Symphony suite which is about  20 minimum drive from lost world.We reach lost world 1030am and out from lost world 0800pm. Then start using Waze app to go for symphony suite, is very straightforward which we reach hotel in less than 20 minutes. When I stop in front of hotel main door and look inside, actually there is no bell boy service but luckily just in front having empty parking, so just park then only unload all my stuff. I saw second come in, then try to horn for service but seem no point to do that haha. Check in very smooth because there is no people queue up but facing some technical issues which is they take my Identification card and still check in wrong person name for me, my booking with one king bed and one single bed and with breakfast, but she gave me one king bed and without breakfasts, after reconfirm then only find out they check in with wrong person name. This is the first time facing this problem but is a good experience, next time I would need to confirm my name first haha.The room is great, clean, spacious and still very new and is very quiet or maybe I too tired sleep without wake up till morning.But one thing is better to fill up your stomach before come here, because surrounding having not much choice of food. I’m after load all my stuff to room then walk to BBQ restaurants beside (5min walk) and enjoy a buffet bbq and steamboat dinner (the food is nice to try). Walking distance there is about 2 restaurants, 2 cafe and one for shopping (rm2 shop)Overall Room - clean, spacious and new Breakfast - don’t have much option but the food  taste good Parking - front and multi level car parkTo improve - Help customer to load and unload luggage from car",Jul 2019,July 2019,Families

Let me tell you why we loved our stay at Symphony Suites.1. Safety (absolutely important)The hotel has its own free indoor parking. We parked at Level 2 most of the time and at any point in time, there was a guard there at the desk there keeping watch. The parking was spacious (parked our SUV with no issues), brightly lit and most importantly, it was guarded. We felt safe coming back at night, parking our car and going to our hotel room.2. Spacious roomsI love how spacious the rooms are. We booked a room that came with one queen bed and one single bed; all three of us slept very comfortably and the room had enough space for us to put our luggage, move around. Even the bathroom was sufficiently spacious.3. CleanEveryone loves a clean hotel room. The floor was dust free, and looked well kept. Our beddings smell fresh and the pillows were fluffy. We liked how well stocked the washroom was with soap, disposable toothbrush and very good water pressure for shower.4. Great locationOkay so this one's a little out of town nearer to Sam Poh Tong cave side but downstairs there were shop lots next door where you can grab a drink at the café, grab dinner at several dining outlets or if you're up to thrift shopping, drop by the RM2 shop to see what good deals you can get. We loved that we could eat within the area without ever having to drive our car out.5. Friendly staffThe front desk staff were very friendly and efficient. When we stayed over the weekend of 16Dec, the hotel was all decked out with Christmas decorations. I had noticed a ornamental display of one snow man, one santa and one reindeer placed at the front desk tabletop was just telling my sister how cute it was. The front desk staff reached out and pressed a button to our surprise, the snowman, santa and reindeer took turns singing a Christmas tune, moving in time to the music. This little deco, thoughtful in its purpose, made all of us laugh in delight and really did put a good whole atmosphere at the check in counter. I like how they even thought of little details like this; if you are checking in, ask about the trio figurine at the check in desk :)6. Good breakfast selectionOur room came with breakfast and it was a good selection of basic breads, rice, porridge, noodles, cereals, fruits etc. Breakfast got really busy when we went down for it at 9 a.m. so you may want to wake up earlier to beat the crowds. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

Aeon Station 18 and Tesco Station 18 is about 5-6km away from this hotel, should you need to buy groceries or watch a movie at TGV Cinema in Aeon Station 18.ParkingTwo parking areas are available; one on the ground floor in front of the hotel lobby which is not covered OR a covered parking on the level 2 of the hotel. The parking bays on the level 2 is quite limited, so first come first serve basis. My stay is during a weekday so I experience no problem in getting a parking bay on the level 2. If you park on the level 2 parking, it is more convenient as there are two lifts available which is connected to the lobby as well as hotel rooms. However, as the other reviewers mentioned, the turn at the lobby to the ramp leading to the covered parking is rather tight, almost at a 90 degree angle, so maneuvering a long wheel base car like Camry or Accord could be a little bit difficult.RoomI was given room 513. The room itself is big with separate living area and bedroom. The room has two toilets, one for the living area (without shower) and one in the bedroom area (with rain shower). Two LED TVs area available for both living area and bedroom area. Safety deposit box, iron board, iron and hair dryer are available in the room. The water pressure for the rain shower is not as strong as to my liking and you have to wait quite a while for hot water. Other than that the linens are clean, the towels also are clean and stain free.WifiWifi is provided only for one device at a time, so if this is something of important to you then you might want to take note. The internet speed is good for browsing and watching YouTube.FacilitiesGym is available, but I didn't have the time to check it out. No swimming pool available, so if you are bringing kids along you might want to consider this. BreakfastThe choices for breakfast is quite minimal, but nevertheless the food is quite tasty. Nasi lemak, fried mee, curry mee, bread toast, cereals, cut fruits are the choices available. They provide homemade teh Tarik as well, which is quite OK but a little bit on the sweet side. Perhaps they can provide a 'less sweet' version of the teh Tarik, would be nice.If you are bringing along your kids you might want to look somewhere else as there is no swimming pool here at the hotel. Having that said, all in all it was a good stay, everything is as per expectations. For the price paid, I think the hotel is a value for money.

Aircons have little room for adjustment so cold air directly blows toward beds, lights ar bathrooms are arranged such a way that they illuminate background, instead of mirror ad of one's face. Wardrobe has built-in lights which is a good intention but the switch turning them off is not functioning properly so light leaks out from them...

Beds were comfortably solid, and shower was great (with a rain shower head) and the hot water was very good and stable. Our room had a mini fridge and kettle, and complimentary tea/coffee and bottled water were provided. Slippers were also provided but only upon request. Parking was free and easy with the option for indoor or outdoor parking.The complimentary buffet breakfast we had was quite standard with some local delicacies and continental breakfast. If you're looking for something to eat outside, there is a Chinese restaurant just two blocks down that serves great noodle dishes.Some bad points I'd like to point out: (1) air-conditioning system was not powerful enough to cool down the room in the afternoon; (2) housekeeping was slow in responding to requests (had to call three times to get an extra tea cup); (3) TV screen was quite blurry and had very limited channels available (not even a single news channel!).Overall, despite a few glitches in our room and the service, we had a pleasant comfortable stay for a reasonable price. One important thing to note is that it's about 15 mins drive away from Ipoh city centre, and Ipoh doesn't have a good public transport system, so having your own car is a necessity.

At the opposite part of this hotel a little further down you can visit some beautiful cave temples (which are one of the major tourist attraction in Ipoh).Taxi's aren't available here , and its 15 mins away from ipoh city ( so ppl who don't have car , i would suggest them to get some kind of transportation ready  upfront).Other than that this boutique hotel is quite nice and pleasant in its own way , and the rooms were big and wonderful for a long stay or a short stay.",Aug 2014,August 2014,Families

A little bit inconvenient as none of the shops adjacent to the hotel is occupied but not a problem as long as you have transport.The room was very spacious, which befits the term “suite”, and the room was sophisticatedly and tastefully decorated. Touch switches for all the room’s lighting controls, concealed lightings, coffee table and armchairs, working desk, flat screen TV and all, even with a full-length frosted glass to the bathroom. The bathroom is also very spacious, with a separated shower which is what I like as it keeps the other parts of the bathroom dry.If there’s anything that I can nick pick on it’d be the breakfast, the spread is quite limited although the food was ok.

The room that I booked was Standard King Suite with buffet breakfast included. My comments are as follows: 1) When I made room reservation through Booking.com, I got 37% discount. So, I was only charged RM320 for 2-night stay.  2) The hotel was easy to find. Waze showed me all the way from my house to the hotel.3) Hotel location is quite strategic as it is surrounded by many shop lots including several fast food restaurants such as KFC, McDonald, Pizza Hut and Old Town White Coffee. 4) My first impression of the hotel was excellent. It looked high class from the outside and inside. Besides, it was very clean from lobby to the lift, corridor and finally to the room.5) The hotel has its own private car park on the 2nd and the 3rd floors with security guards.6) Check in was very slow. It took about 10 minutes. However, check out was fast.7) When I checked-in, I was asked if I had a preference of newspapers and I said ""yes"". However, I didn't receive any newspapers the second day. I only received it on the last day.8) Deposit is not required upon check-in. One interesting thing is that even though I was alone, I was still given 2 room cards. Based on my experience, very few hotels are willing to do so.9) Staffs were friendly especially the hotel manager, Mr. Dalbeer. He was very professional, courteous, welcoming and helpful. He fulfilled all of my special but reasonable requests. Thank you, Mr. Dalbeer :)10) The hotel has high tech features, especially in the rooms where you find touch screens on the walls that allow you to control the lighting in the room and also to call for room service.11) The room that I booked was a smoking room but surprisingly, it didn't smell like smoke. Instead, it smelled good. 12) The room was very clean and spacious and it provides a nice view of tall trees and the mountain.   13) The room was also provided with two bottles of drinking water and basic hotel amenities including a mini fridge and a safe deposit box.  14) An information booklet which contains in-room dining menu, TV channels, guest directions (i.e. who to contact if we need help), Ipoh favorite restaurants, shopping malls, tourist spots and etc. was available in the room. 15) TV has 11 channels including Astro, Fox Movie and Fox Sport and its reception was ok.16) There were 2 huge mirrors: one was in the room and another one was in the bathroom. But don't worry, the one in the room was not facing the bed.17) Air-Cond was cold.18) Bed and pillows were very comfortable. 19) Although the lighting in the room was quite dim, a table lamp with adjustable brightness was available in the room.20) Wi-Fi speed was ok. Although in day 1, I only managed to access to the Internet at night; I had Internet access the next day for the whole day. 21) Just like the room, bathroom was spacious and clean. It smelled good too. Its basin bowl and sitting toilet were so big! More importantly, its rain shower was excellent.22) A set of toiletries was provided: toothbrush, tooth paste, soap, shower cap, sanitary bag, shampoo and bath gel. This is much better than those hotels that provide either soap only or very tiny bottles of bath gel only. 23) I didn't use my own towels. Instead, I used the ones provided in the bathroom because they looked clean and smelled fresh.24) There is a café in the hotel. I tried some of its food: Symphony Fried Rice, Ipoh Ho Fun, Mix Garden Green Salad, Spicy Sautéed Onion & Sausages, and Carrot Juice. Delicious but expensive. 25) The buffet breakfast spread was quite good and delicious. There was also an omelet station. 26) In the last day, when I finished my breakfast and about to leave the café, I happened to find that 14 rooms were occupied on the floor that I stayed. However, my room was extremely quiet the 3 days 2 nights I was there. The room was really soundproof! Overall, although this is a 3-star hotel, I felt like staying in a 5-star hotel. I definitely will go back to this hotel again.",Aug 2014,August 2014,Business

My expectation is very simple as it is not for pleasure but for convenience. FYI, my main mode of reservation would be via agoda, booking.com and the likes. There's a few promoting this hotel but sadly most would offer just rooms without  breakfast offer. I find this quite inconvenient esp if you are travelling for business. For booking.com for instance, only the executive rooms are offered with breakfast deal. I noted that the hotel website itself offers in its ""sale"" option with breakfast but that the rate offered makes it more expensive than that for Impiana Hotel Ipoh which has great breakfast selection (Impiana is considered THE hotel still in Ipoh..old but still ""4"" star quality) as Impiana is located in  a more centralised location with swimming pool etc.Enough ranting about breakfast, but really the management should be more welcoming to business community. As for rooms, I have only tried the standard room which I do like the deco. However, my husband (who's been there for the past 2 weeks before this and was upgraded to its deluxe room due to unavailability of the std room booked) mentioned that the deluxe room is great, spacious and comfortable.Location, only a local like me (it is my hometown) or those with businesses nearby would appreciate this location. It is not centralised though it is facing a very busy main road which accessible straight to the town centre.One plus point which lacking in many hotels in Ipoh its perfect carpark facilities..either on site of on the second level.

The waitress in the coffee house, Miss Viney was also very friendly and courteous.A good hotel to stay for visits to the many limestone caves and old temples nearby.A must try in the town centre is the famous chicken and bean sprout dish-the hotel should be able to direct you to the restaurant.

Was highly recommended by the locals but is always fully booked. Finally check in today but major disappointment. Not as good as what people claims or what people reviewed here. As an avid traveller, the hotel is rather old and run down. The first bad impression was the check in process. The staff at the concierge tries to be efficient but check in took such a long time despite the fact that I have already made full paymeny via Agoda. System network slow the staff claimed. After finally waiting for quite some time to process my check in, was rather disappointing to find the room was merely ordinary as compared to what was shown on the Agoda. Bathroom tiles are old, stained and mouldy. Bedsheet and pillow cases stained and tainted. Wifi is very bad. And worst of all, the swimming pool that the locals boast so much about this hotel is closed down. Oh well. Since the pool is closed so tried to watch TV in the room instead. Poor reception in the room that the TV programmes was halted a few times. Haven't try the breakfast for tomorrow morning yet but let's hope it is not lame too. Fingers crossed. All in all, I think this hotel has been over promoted than what it delivers. I have stayed in better boutique hotels around the area or even in Seri Iskandar. They maybe just shop lots converted hotels but is clean, cheaper but excellent service and most of all comfortable enough for a traveller like me to rest and to come back again and again.

The hotel is rather old, or looks like it, but is rather well maintained, with an old fashioned wooden reception that shies away from modern minimalism. The lobby is extremely spacious and this is probably the constant theme of the hotel. Over-size. The restaurant is also very large, and ws completely empty, probably works more as a function room for large gatherings, particularly given the choice of eateries in walking distance from the hotel, literally a few steps away from it. You have Malay, Chinese and a western bistro/bar on the corner as well as a shopping mall next door, and lots of small shops mainly targeting the large student population around, due to the proximity with 2 universities. Breakfast is served in a different area from the main restaurant, it is also large, and tables are well spaced, so it doesn't feel cramped at all. The breakfast choice was the usual, though it wasn't displayed in the most appealing way. Mediocre I'd say, however it did include an egg station, baked beans as well as noodles, bread, jam and fruit. Buffet style. Rooms? Large, very large. The bathroom too, perfectly adequate. The rooms are nothing special, in terms of amenities you have your very usual 2 armchairs around a small round table, a desk, TV, double bed and a small balcony which you can really go to, as access is through the window and it houses the AC external unit. But it gives a nice look from the outside. The bed was rather comfortable, the linens are possibly synthetic, and caused me to sweat a lot, despite having the AC on, but that is something that happens to me more and more often. So nothing specific to this hotel. All in all it was a reasonably comfortable hotel, not particularly charming or ""special"" in any way, but the size of the rooms.

My tip - spend at least a whole day wandering round eating at various venues and taking photos! This town started to die in the 80s when the tin mines ceased operating and was almost killed off when the North-South highway turned it from a waypoint on the long drive to Penang, into a sleepy backwater as it became completely bypassed in the 90s. Enter UNITAR (University TAR) which brought thousands of students, hundreds of staff and support workers and a reinvigoration of the local economy. Kampar New Town was born on the site of the old mine and with it came this hotel. Big rooms, comfortably furnished, helpful and friendly staff day and night, adequate though not spectacular breakfast, but a very good in-house Chinese restaurant. RM130++ per night B+B was a real bargain. I would definitely recommend, whether for business stopover or as a base for exploring Perak and seeing a Malaysian town as it was 40-50 years ago.

We booked the Premier King Room directly with the hotel and got a good rate including breakfast.  Parking is free if you're driving and there's an AEON Mall just round the corner (5minutes walk).  Pros of the room we got:  spacious with a very sitting area, comfy bed with nice firm pillows, lovely decor, big bathroom that included two sinks, a safe to keep your valuables, mini fridge and even an illy coffee machine with coffee pods.  Cons:  room is not sound-proof...  you can hear what's going on outside in the hall as well as hear conversations of people inside the rooms if you're right outside.  In addition, the slippers provided for guests inside the room are the re-wearable type so if you feel icky about wearing slippers that have been worn by countless other strangers, you probably want to bring your own.  Another thing which bothered me a little was this electronic clock that is normally displayed on the bedside table was lying unplugged and with a crack on the display.  I'm not sure whether it was not working or whether hotel guests are expected to look around for a plug point to plug it in but I didn't examine it too closely as it was slightly dusty and we didn't need the clock display.  I just felt it was really strange to just leave it there rather than plugged in or if it was not working, to take it away as it was pretty unsightly.  Minor gripe I know but thought I'll mention it.  Other than that, we did enjoy ourselves in this boutique style hotel plus the nasi lemak for breakfast was pretty good.  If you want good dim sum, there's a good one called Dynasty Palace just 500m from the hotel.  Will definitely be back if we need a hotel to stay in Ipoh next round or maybe try its sister hotel nearer to town for convenience.",Jun 2018,June 2018,Couples

It’s really unique. When you into the hotel, it gives you a nice feeling and very nice deco too and nice ambient lighting. Check in was quite efficient not much hassle. We book the king room but it is not available and we have to settle for the queen bed room. When you get out from the lift on the second floor where our room is located, the hall way is seriously warm and no aircond at all. That is not a very good experience. The room though are quite nice decorated. But the furnitures you have in the room is nice to see but not so practical I’m afraid. It is not very user friendly. At the edge of the bed there was like a cloth lantern hanging there and if you are taller you need to be careful or your head may knock against it. The best thing about the room is the bath room. Looks fabulous with the subway tiles just amazing. Love it. The shower area have lots of space which is good. The sink is a bit high thought and the water tap is kind of Long. If you ar washing your face and bend forward your head may hit on the tap. Location wise it is near the AEON mall. But if you want to go to the city centre it is quite far. Parking is by the roadside along the shop houses.  Heinz the hotel have some covered Parkin good too but not many lots about 5 or 6 lots.

We liked the tastefully designed interior, spaciousness of the room and large bathroom with double sinks.  Another cool design feature is the beautiful building façade comprising old doors and shutters.  We could open all the curtains and yet maintain our privacy as the façade allowed light to be filtered in and yet act as a screen.  One grouse though was there was no wardrobe and hardly anywhere to hang our clothes.  The hip factor pervaded in the design of the common areas, from the reception and lobby to the corridors.  Ample seating is provided in the lobby as well as the areas next to the room corridors, with sturdy armchairs and sofas inviting you to linger.With no in house kitchen, breakfast was catered with the independent Japanese restaurant on the ground floor.  The quality of breakfast could be improved and a wider range of beverage provided.  Only Japanese green tea and black coffee were available for breakfast.  I don't think it is too difficult to include English tea.Our Ipoh friends found the hotel inconvenient as it is not near town.  We did not mind travelling around 15 to 20 minutes to town since we were on a rest and relax holiday and Uber rides were cheaply priced.Service was good.  I didn't get the name of the helpful staff who seemed to be the general dogsbody - he served our breakfast and responded our request for toiletries quickly.Whilst there are some areas for improvement, I would still recommend the hotel as I am a sucker for cool design.

Parking was a breeze and safety was assured by the hotel staff, which left us feeling positive as we were checking in. The whole process was pleasurable and swift. The problems only started as we stepped into the room, which was a premier suite. It's sad to say that the room was not as clean as it could have been. The floor was sticky so had been wearing the indoor slippers throughout the stint. It's too bad that it didn't end there. The side of the curtain rail was falling and although the hotel staff responded swiftly, there's nothing much that can be done. The shower head in the bathroom came off albeit still functioning. While the design was cool, it wasn't the most thoughtful. Side tables weren't within each from the bed if you're petite. The television was facing the coffee area and had you choose to sit on either the couch or the bed, you won't have a front view. How strange! Also a bit of a turn off is the poor sound-proof of the room. I could hear the rain, noises from neighbours and other guests who passed by. I would love to give a 3.5 stars for the prompt delivery of shampoo and shower gel as I ran out of those. Not to mention that they good and the conditioner left my hair feeling soft too!

Gotta say this stay shows much improvement from the last. Room are neatly cleaned and I do like the layout of the suite, for couples you’ll like the big shower and the double basin. As a person who perform a throughout check after check in, there was a few points I need to mention though. Room is clean, but everything has to check before a guest check in. That being said, one of the lamp isn’t working and the bedside alarm dock was unplug as well. The decor pillows look fancy, but when was the last time it was clean/wash? I removed them from the bed after check in but next morning they were place on the bed again. It does looks filthy. My only harsh complain this time probably was the Frozen character at the reception, Elsa. True that I’m checking by my own, but all rooms are configured for two guest minimum and when I ask for two key cards don’t tell me the hotel is running low on key cards and simply give excuses as such. Probably she’s train like that because she even told me the hotel was fully book and I couldn’t check in early at 12pm - but I did. Overall stay was pleasant as I love this area at the outskirts of Ipoh. That simply mean quiet nights and a good night sleep. One recommendation I would to make. Would be nice if there’s a carpet at the seating area for the Premier King Suite. It will glam up the area and also the furniture won’t be moving around easily. Signing off and thanks to Lloyd & Pam for the booking arrangements for us. My friends enjoy the stay and the comfy bed as well. See you all again someday.

The outlook of the hotel gives you how detailed and the effort Lloyd, the owner and his team put in to make M Boutique Station 18 special. The recycled wooden doors, the oversize glass panels with steel frames, the tasteful decors are just a part of the WOW the guest gets from the outside. Coming into the lobby, a blast of golden yellow lights makes a person feel the place is takes the word ""fancy"" to a different level. The oldies song and the sofa sets is just calling for a good book and some hot coffee on a lazy afternoon. The staff was really friendly, welcoming, helpful and professional which made me gave the hotel a 5 star. Even the housekeeping staff were a great bunch, we met some in the elevator and at the washing room. All were great people. Moving to the room, the setup was amazing! The deco, the clever use of space and the selection of bathroom tiles was just perfect. No wonder they spend more on deco than the renovation work itself (Ipoh's Chic Hotel, The Star, 21st Sept 2015). The generous amount of pillows and cushions and the plush bedding made sleeping worth every minute. What amazes me most is the branding and how they incorporate that into all their amenities the provide for the guest in the room. The only thing I found weird was there were 2 lamps beside the dressing table but there are not enough plug points for both because the little fridge use one of the 2 provided. Then there is the audio set which is able to charge a mini USB smartphone but without its cable. Lastly the use of a extension cord next to the side table. These are just nitpicking issues but not a big deal. This hotel although is about 15mins drive from the city, it is still worth staying because of where it is situated. Next to Aeon Mall makes it all the more reason because of the convenience. We even managed to catch a late night show without able to worry about the distance. Not to mention Speedmart 99 just across the street.Ipoh draws us like a moth to the fire because of its charming people, amazing food and the atmosphore it gives its visitors.

And at 8pm when we came back, the laundry trolley was still at the foyer. Quite unsightly, given the good interior design. Also we informed the reception to refill the tissue paper in the morning but wasn't done despite taking down our room number. And on second day, the box of tissue was jus placed on vanity top instead of putting it in the tissue box holder. The beer and glass used the night before were just left as where we left them on the second day. Definitely need to work on housekeeping and to pay more attention to little details.

The room was very spacious, so was the bathroom. The fittings are a mix of old and new and they definitely put quite abit of thought into their room concept. The best surprise were the beds! Super comfortable! The illy coffee capsules and machine provided in the room was also a nice touch for a coffee junkie like me. The only odd feature was the ironing boards which were placed in the communal areas. Having to iron your clothes in the corridor when the hotel is fully booked can feel a little awkward...aside from that, the hotel itself is very ""instagrammable"" - hence the hipster description.... haha!Anyway, service was generally very friendly. Our bathroom door was stuck (couldn't close) and despite only informing them close to midnight, they made a valiant attempt at trying to fix it and were apologetic when they couldn't. They offered to change our room but were unable to accommodate as it was fully booked that weekend. Thankfully, thanks to my friend's ingenuity, we were able to fix it ourselves in the end.For those of you unfamiliar with Ipoh, I would not recommend this location as it is a little out of the way and there isn't much to see unless you count the aeon mall as a local attraction. Location wise it's better suited for those who have been to Ipoh before and prefer a place away from the hustle and bustle of town (which can be pretty busy during holiday season). Pretty much everything you need to see and early in Ipoh is within 15-20 minutes anyway. Price wise I'd say it was good value (we paid ~rm275 per night for the family queen room that sleeps 4) by KL standards, perhaps maybe a little pricey by Ipoh standards (considering the location).",Jun 2017,June 2017,Friends

Ran out of toilet paper and tissues by evening of first day! Perhaps housekeepers should check everything at every room tidy.Before the group went out for dinner we requested for the air-conditioning to be checked. On our return, we were told that it had been checked but it was still broken. The night staff, Hassan, confirmed it was not working. We asked for a fan but was told there wasn't any in the hotel. Through Hassan's great initiative and thoughtfulness he went home to get his own fan for us. It was 1.00am by then. We live in England, so are not accustomed to temperatures of 30C +. The fan generates its own heat, so it was a poor night's sleep.Earlier on at about 10.30pm, we asked for ice to cool ourselves down but we're told there was none. We find it quite shocking that in a country with temperatures of 30C, ice is not available 24/7. May we suggest that a small freezer be procured and kept under the reception counter. It's a very basic problem that can be easily resolved. The mini fridge was not working, so our drinks were still warm after a whole day in it.One of the armchairs had a broken leg!We raised the above issues with the manager the next morning (an Indian lady) who was apologetic but said she couldn't offer any compensation as we had paid!

In response, I received a phone call promptly from the hotel with an apology and a promise that it would take a higher sense of due diligence and assurance.""To Whom It Concerns:This is feedback to express both my delight and disappointment with my 1-night’s stay at your Ipoh establishment on Dec 23rd 2016.As a former Malaysian now living in Australia, I have not visited Ipoh for many years and this time that to spend an overnight stay to fulfil my gastronomical needs.We were delighted to find the place as described and the uniqueness, cosiness and art décor reinforced our decision to stay there. The location was also convenient as the Aeon mall was only a short walking distance away and we were about 15 minutes into the township by car. All was going well and our first impressions were very good indeed.At the end of a long  day of travelling, feasting and visitations, we turned in for the night; that’s where my issue began.As I turned the doonah (quilt/blanket) over to climb in for my sleep, I note a strong odour familiar to that of old vomit. The smell of vomit was also evident on the pillows on my side of the bed. The pillows on my wife’s side also smelt like the pillow cases had not been changed as there was obvious “other people’s” odours on them. To make it worse, all the cushions that were on the bed also smelt of vomit but had the smelly sides faced inwards to cover the odour. It was obvious to me that Housekeeping was aware of this situation but decided to hide the problem and hoped no one notices….???As it was close to 1.00 AM (24th Dec) and I was literally worn out, I pushed the doonah aside, turned over the pillows and laid the cushions along the wall to mask the smell.I did not call reception and decided to “tough it out”, as it was only for one night; although the situation should NEVER have arisen in the first place.I ended up attempting to get some shuteye on the couch using the bath towel as a pillow and adjusting the air-conditioner to an acceptable temperature without the need of a blanket (as there was none). I think I managed a 2-3 hours of interrupted and uncomfortable sleep on the couch, rising early (6 am) and made the situation known to the front desk at my first opportunity. This was when I was provided with these two e-mail addresses upon my request to which I’ve provided my feedback.I hope that, as management, you’d look into the quality assurance matter of your housekeeping services using a variety of tried and tested QA methodologies available in the hospitality industry. I hope too that no other customer or guests of M-Boutique will have the same unpleasantness that my wife and I experienced. Afterall, the best of everything that a hotel has to offer still ends up with one simple truth that a guest needs at the end of the day/night; a good night’s sleep.I thank you for your attention.Sincerely....""",Dec 2016,December 2016,Couples

The use of vintage materials can be seen at every facet of the hotel. We came for a one nighter with our two young children (2yo and 5yo). We stayed at the family room with 2 queen beds. The rate is amazing. The room itself is huge and it even can fit an additional bed comfortably. They are also not stingy with pillows! There must have been about 8 large pillows and tons of smaller ones. All the usual amenities are included but with a bit of edge in the design. There is an Illy coffee machine in the room!! They provide about 4 capsules which I think can be refilled if required.  The bathroom is huge too but I think the design could be better optimized to suit the number of people the room can handle. The thing is, with the openness of the shower and toilet right opposite the double sink counter, you literally cannot have more than 1 person using the toilet due to privacy issue. If the occupants of the rooms are husband and wife, that's probably ok to share the bathroom. But relatives or friends? Maybe not. If there is a door / separator that could be installed that could separate the toilet and shower area from the double sink counter, that would solve the problem definitely. We did not use the café facility except for breakfast. They don't have a buffet but they do have about 10 choices of food from nasi lemak to waffles and salmon Panini sandwich. The food is OK, but the coffee is marvelous! and they are open till 12 that day. Amazing. All in all, we had a good time.",Aug 2016,August 2016,Families

Firstly, i have to give my utmost thanks to the amazing staffs for the excellent service. I had a very late check-in at 11pm. After having to travel from KL after a long working day, I was immediately greeted with a very warm and cheerful welcome by Pamela and that is very De-stressing. Very energetic and super friendly lady who even helped me to get supper, knowing that the streets aren't safe at that hour. Also, a big thank you to Robin Hood (Ridzuan) for walking me down to 7-11 to ensure my safety, always ready to provide assistance and grinning all the time. These are the little things about having passion in what we're doing, and going that extra miles, which is hardly seen/shown these days. Frankly, I've recently stayed in Marriot and some 5* hotels, but never did i get such excellent service and a friendly welcome. Kudos to you guys!Room: Checked in the cozy Superior Room with a four poster Queen bed-very comfortable, 2-seater sofa-nice corner to chill and read my book, working desk-pretty good to work on that i ended up spending few hours doing my work, fridge-3 canned drinks provided, kettle, bottled water, telephone, TV, etc. Was exactly the same as shown in the pictures on their website. In-room facilities are complete. All basic necessities are well provided. Toilet is super clean, good water pressure with hot/cold shower, toiletries and hairdryer. Wi-Fi is excellent! Went across the street and I can still can Wi-Fi! Hotel Facilities and interior: I love almost everything abut the decor. All things old and vintage. The hanging lights along the corridor, the set up of the seating area near the lift, and the laundry room with a reading corner. No charges for getting your laundry done- laundry and dryer. I've read some reviews commenting on the squeaky noises from the corridor floor, I think it's all fixed now. During my stay, not a squeak i hear. Except when someone rolls their luggage. Hotel lobby has nice decor and display too, nice place to chill out for afternoon tea with a book.EspressoBar: Pretty cool place too. Only see people in the evenings. The food menu didn't quite get my attention, so nothing I've tried there. But very limited choices for breakfast food and drinks. They only had like 3 different kinds of omelette, one or two local dish, and another item- if i recall correctly. Choice of drinks, coffee/tea/milk. The omelette I had was quite 'jelak'. There's room for improvement on this.Surroundings: Just a stone throw away from AEON. Many choices for food and beverages. There's a supermarket for stocking up your midnight snacks and some shopping too! Taxi ride to the murals area took about 20 mins (around RM15). Station 18 is a quieter part of the town unlike the city area. If you are planning not to spend too much on taxis, you might want to consider their sister hotel M Boutique Hotel or somewhere in that area where most places are feasible by foot. Overall: Fantastic place to stay, and marvelous staffs!! Good place to get away from the busy and noisy streets. Great for people like me who wants a short get away to get work done and read a book. Seriously..it's great value for $$! Will definitely recommend this hotel, and I'll be back in 2 weeks time!! See Ya!P.S: I think the furniture in the room needs a bit of dusting.

The location is easy to find using Waze.  It is conveniently located across the Aeon Ipoh Station 18 Mall and about a 20 minutes’ drive to Jalan Sultan Iskandar which is the main road near the popular eateries.  We were there during the weekend and there was ample parking space in front of the hotel.  Check-in was smooth with excellent customer service from Maleficent.  We booked a Superior Queen room and was given a room on the 2nd floor.  The minute we stepped out of the elevator we noticed how the floor boards creaked with every step leading up to our room.  There was a broken floor board on the 2nd floor lobby area which was quite hazardous.  A barrier protection should have been set up around it until it could be fixed but there was none for the 2 nights we were there.  Totally agree with the rest of the reviewers that the management should look into replacing their flooring as it is highly audible when someone walks on it.  The only drawback to this hotel were the floor boards and the lack of cable TV channels.   On the positive side; the WiFi signal was strong with fast connection speeds.  We appreciated how our problem with the bathroom was attended to immediately.  Ample amount of bath & hand towels with a full set of toiletries provided.

The choice for in-house guest is either Myth (cafe at lobby) or AEON Station 18. For people who visit to Ipoh, I'm sure visitors would more likely prefer local delicates or any speciality mouth-watering food in Ipoh. It's good to try Myth cafe, but for whole family & more varieties of locals food, this may be little losing gap in between.The staff are generally good, security wise are good, where visitors need to access to the entrance by room card or control press by admin in front desk. Overall, the idea and concept are great, remain the heritage elements with care. Keep it up!",Mar 2016,December 2015,Families

But the good thing about this place is, it's just next to a huge shopping mall calle AEON Mall Station 18. U can find almost everything there... Well, lets start it out with the hotel itself... the renovation outside the hotel is marvelous... very stylish and it's so designer-feel like. The moment you walk in to the ""lobby"" which is more like a boutique-style shop more than a hotel-like...i was greeted by a guy who name Thor (sound cool) and check in was a breeze. Every corner of the lobby is cozy and trendy.. u can selfie almost everywhere.I got the room on 1st Floor (there only have 2 story anyway) and my room is facing the AEON Mall, so it's much quieter. BTW, the location of this hotel is on a more quieter side, so no worry on the traffic sound from the main room. The whole room deco and the way they make it is very different. The concept they bring in to the room is cozy, simple, trendy and hip. They painted the wall into black and the bed frame is steel-frame (olden days kindda bed), the writing table is all make from steel frame and the toilet design is just outstanding. It's bright and big. Each room come with a LED tv and the bed is super comfy. There have enough of pillow for me to choose and the linen is clean and comfy. They do provide bathrobe and super comfy sandal. (why i did mention this is, most of the boutique hotel i have stay, they dont provide such fine details into each of every room)... They even come with a mini fridge and ipod/iphone/android dock for charging and listening to music (another add-point).The room i book come with a breakfast and the breakfast serve at MYTH Espresso Bar/Cafe which is located at the Ground Floor. The breakie they provide is not buffet style but it's a selection from a menu. They cook according to your selection, therefore the serving time might need a bit longer. Well, that doesn't seems to bother me as the cafe/restaurant on the ground floor is so trendy, u can just simply walk around and snap some photo of it.All in all...if you go to Ipoh again in near future...pls do try out this boutique hotel. It's something different from the other and i believe, i will be staying here again very soon. Personally i rather stay in this area (Station 18) coz the parking seems like easier and it's free (as of now).Keep up the good work M Boutique Hotel Group, you have set a high benchmark for a boutique hotel in Malaysia.",Mar 2016,March 2016,Couples

Though, that's all you'll get because you don't see a lot of hotel staffs around.we loved:1. the stool in the shower, we didn't know what it's for at first, probably just for display, but shortly after we placed it under the rain shower, we knew immediately, especially after a long day walk, this is paradise!2. very convenient electric extension placed at the right place! especially for electronic freaks like us3. a handful of complimentary drinks! thank you.4. the shampoo is by far the best of all the hotels i've stayed, i even got a bottle from the boutique at the lobby, at guest's rate, nice~nothing's perfect though, some things that are still in need of improvements such as:1. the pillow, it's either too hard or too soft, we actually got shoulder pain after a night stay2. the welcome snack and drink is a warm gesture, but please pass it to the guests upon check in, it isn't quite a pleasant surprise when we sees it in on our desk 3. the compact room itself deserves a tad bit more breathing space i would say, the displays and racks are chic, but it made the room a little cluttered4. Also due to the clutter, the bed has to be adjacent to the wall, which is not very convenient, i've gotta climb over the couch to get to the toilet so that i won't wake up the person next to me5. consistent maintenance of the wooden floor at the corridor is highly appreciated, it makes very irritating sound whenever someone pass byi'll be back, for sure, at this rate, you shouldn't be able to get anything better.",Jan 2016,January 2016,Couples

It's a big mall with a lot of shops in there. Though it's not near the city, it's fine with us as we planned to drive around to visit the different attractions. Driving to Concubine Lane (tourist area) takes about 20-30mins.Both rooms were very clean and well kept. For the premier room, there was no bath tub but the shower area was very clean and nice. It comes with the rain shower and shower head. Water is hot and pressure is good. Mattress was very comfortable. However, the comforter looks old and worn out.Sachets of local coffee were also available in the room.There is also a washing machine and dryer located on level 3 for common usage among the guests. Guests can choose to sit around in the cozy area while waiting for laundry to be done.After 11pm, the lobby is locked and guest have to enter with an access card.

Otherwise, cars can be parked along the road and the hotel claimed that they will keep a lookout.Overall, the experience is very good. Try ask for a room NOT above the hotel lobby but facing the back of hotels. The wooden planks on the floor of level 2 and 3 are a bit ""loose"" and made a lot of creaking sounds.

Everything is beautiful at every corner. Every little detail in this hotel is carefully designed and customized to suit their beautiful theme.Upon arrival, the lobby staff greeted us and proceeded to help us with the check in. We were thankful to be able to get room 202, away from the lift and it also comes with a view. However, do note that the floors along the corridors are made of very loud squeaky wooden flooring, thus if possible do request for rooms away from the lift to minimize hearing footsteps outside all the time. Rooms were very tastefully designed, and every little detail contain delightful finds, even their clothes hanger and toiletries bottles are customised and specially designed. However, the rooms are quite small and have limited walking space or even space to put our luggages. Upon entering, our first impression is good as the cleanliness level on the surface looks good. However, upon inspection, we found that the housekeeping just did a good job cleaning on the basic surface level only. All the furniture in the rooms are very dusty. Only the table tops are wiped clean, but the bottom and the edges and all the other corners are filled with thick dust. This is very disappointing as cleanliness is very important in the rooms that we stay. The rooms come with a chiller for drinks. It is very nice that they provided us with many bottles of bottled water instead of just 2 bottles. However, they also put in two cans of carbonated drinks inside, and it comes with no price tag and there is no sign anywhere stating that the drinks are chargeable. Luckily I called the receptionist to clarify and she informed us that the drinks are RM3 each. Luckily we did not open the drinks. I feel it is unfair to charge customers for drinks in the room if there is no notice anywhere in the fridge or the room that it is chargeable. Hope the management can look into this.Another thing to note is that although the staff at the lobby greeted us with a basic smile, I feel this beautiful hotel can do even better if the staff can be trained to greet customers with extra warmth and enthusiasm. After all, beautiful hotels can be found everywhere and anywhere but the only thing that separates one business from another is its service and genuine warmth of the staff service. There was no other customer when we checked in and checked out, however the staff was just cordial and proceeded to do their work to process the check in with no other small talk with us or telling us to enjoy our stay. During check out, another staff was busy discussing on a file with a colleague and after processing our check out she continued her discussion with the colleague on the work file. No words of thank you, please come again, no small chats with our kids or any other conversations.This is a beautiful hotel with big potentials, I hope they can improve their cleanliness level and also inject some local warmth in their staff friendliness, then it will be an awesome place to stay.",Dec 2015,December 2015,Families

There is a minimart about 200m away from the hotelUpon check in, we were welcome by a very friendly Indian lady staff. don't expect to check in early as the hotel have limited rooms and is very popular. however, the staff will contact you at the earliest if any room is ready. The hotel actually will call you the day of arrival to confirm the reservation. If you booked with agoda, booking,com or similar, your room rate do not come with breakfast(continental only) unless you booked directly with them.  The hotel only served continental breakfast, no buffet or american style breakfast.

After 23:00hrs, entry to the hotel would required your room key card to activate the entry. There is 4-private car parks located behind the hotel and is limited, the car park lots in front of the hotel are for public and always full. There is a big pantry for self service laundry with detergent provided and a drinking water dispenser for refilling as the house water bottle is very small size. the pantry is beautiful decorated and have seating areas too.The restaurant have a small menu with limited breakfast offer but can ordered their extensive ala-carte thoughtout the day; 3-dishes in their breakfast menu at MYR 16.90 each. But their food quality and presentation are good and fresh. No in-room dining service. The service team are very friendly. They do sell their custom made cockeries to customer; do expect to pay a high price as they are custom made. Most of our meal are taken care either at the mall or at the local eateries behind the hotel. Room ... i have a cabin room with no window, a king/queen room with window, and a double room with window. Cabin room is the most cheapest room and is much bigger than the double room with window. The cabin room has a open concept washroom but is very spacious; you can sleep on the floor and take shower. The handwash basin area can take 4-people at one time. The interior and bed are very comfortable. Scent Shampoo, conditioner and bodywash are available complimentary. 2-miniature bottle drinking water are given daily during the cleaning up. there are also 2-small tibit with special packing given daily at turndown service. There is no bathtub in both cabin, king/queen and double bed rooms. I'm not sure other rooms have bathtub.When you booked the double room, do specify you need one king bed because the bed in the room are 2-single bed and even you join them together there is still a gap in between both bed and can be uncomfortable. The double room is much spacious than the king/queen room. I can say the king/queen room is the smallest room; the bed and tv is laid at the side. the king/queen bed room do have a 2-sofa in front of the bed. The washroom of both double and king/queen room is very small too.Room with window do made no difference with room without window. The window is either blocked by the exterior decor of the hotel or with no view.There are also suite and family rooms in the hotel. All Room decor is very colonial style ... that's the plus point!Minibar is not working all the time; have 3-cans of drink offered but chargable! the complimentary hot drink only have local black coffee bag ... really strong, bitter and powerful!TV channels are extremely poor. Hotel should consider upgrading it even knowing the guest are out of the room during the day.WIFI is strong and has good coverage around the hotel and the rooms.Safe box is available in the room.Air con in the room are good working condition and quiet.Room attendant and porter are the same people. they are friendly and prompt. do remember to put your DND sign outside before you sleep.The wood at the walking corridor can be very annoying as it make sound when someone walk at the corridor. The corridor at both floor are well decorated and can kill your camera.Gift shop at the lobby sell their custom made clothing and in-room accessories ... reasonable and can be expensive.

Location is quiet on a weekday when we were there but it could be busy as it is right across from the Aeon Station 18 mall which is convenient if you need to get something from the supermarket or watch a movie.We enjoyed their 25% discounted rate on their Superior Room which worked out to be RM 142.50 for 2 persons including breakfast. Our room on the 2nd floor was quiet and there was a washer, dryer and reading room with a water dispenser on this floor. Very convenient if you need hot water from the dispenser without needing to boil or to wash your clothes if you are staying longer. We love our black and white room with creative decor, nice touches like a ziplock bag to store the spare toilet roll in the bathroom to prevent it from getting wet, coffee/tea making facilities, clothes hangers with interesting quotes, a big TV and an iPod/iPhone docking station (which was not useful as we have Android devices).Bathroom was spotlessly clean with nice amenities. There was even a stool in the shower area which is helpful for senior citizens or those with injury. The only suggestion is to keep the hair dryer away from the washbasin as it gets wet from water splashes and this is dangerous when you switch it on.Breakfast was lovely with 4-5 options to choose from and the portions were of a good size. We loved the Myth Cafe where breakfast was served as it is uniquely decorated as well and there was beautiful morning light that came streaming in from the big windows.Wifi speed was good, lobby looks comfy and inviting, and there was a few covered parking bays behind the hotel with direct access to the hotel.The reason this review was a 4 was because the first room we were given had a faulty bathroom door that could not be locked and it slid open by itself.

It's right next to Aeon the Mall. Pretty convenient if you wanna watch a movie on ur short holiday. The lobby of the hotel is very hipster-ish with a coffee/breakfast cafe named MYTH. You can buy elegantly designed M hotel branded items in the lobby. Check in was fast, the desk clerk spoke good English. We stayed in a twin room on the 2nd floor. The beds were not as comfy as I expected them to be (it was hard), with all the money spent on the decor, one would expect awesome beds as well. The comforter was comfy though. Standard toiletries were provided in the swanky bathroom. Just remember to turn on the heater switch if you want a hot shower in the morning.The issues we faced was with the sliding toilet door. it wouldn't lock and it would slide back a few inches leaving a wide gap. We did ask for it to be looked at but was told that the contractor had been informed and since it was a weekend, it wouldn't be fixed in time. Since there was no more twin rooms, they offered us to use another room's toilet OR we can move to a new queen room. We thought it was weird to sleep in one room (the clerk said that it was the usual SOP if these kinda cases occur - i mean like.. whhhy do you suggest it in the first place?) and pee/bathe in another so we decided to check out the new queen room. It smelt of mould and .. it wasn't pleasant. So in the end we just stayed in the current room and sorted out the sliding door issue by jamming a cloth in the gap between the wall and door. Other than that, it was an OK stay. They had an iPod dock, some sort of 'cooler' for drink, tea and coffee facilities in the room and free self laundry facilities. Rated it average mainly cause of the quality of sleep we got wasn't up to expectations.

Even with my obsessive tendencies, M is pretty impressive and makes up in facilities what it lacks in size. Having stayed at both the original M Boutique at Hala Datoh 2, and this time, its new sister, M Boutique Station 18 at Pengkalan, we still found the hotel a novelty with its exterior of vintage window shutters and unexpected range of souvenir items - from home fragrances to fedoras. With its creative merging of themes, the hotel will, without a doubt, charm you. Our queen room featured a 4-poster bed with every kind of pillow imaginable, a great classic black & white bathroom with fat fluffy towels galore and funky denim robes - with hoods [ in case you were having a gangsta moment and wanted to wear yours to AEON next door wink emoticon ] Everything was fully functional, water pressure was great and there was no need to call reception for anything. The hotel also has a few cozy nooks on every floor where you can read, or have a quiet chitchat. When we came back to our room after dinner, the staff had left us tasty muruku snacks and more drinking water in the distinctive M-brand packaging. Thoughtful little gestures like this aren’t generally practiced in small hotels, so thumbs up for that. Aside from our room being slightly small and a rug with trippy corners, there were no other glitches. M Boutique Station 18 also features its own laundry room for guests’ convenience and monitored parking on the street in front of the hotel. If you fancy lobby shopping, there’s a clothes & souvenir boutique as well. The hotel’s Myth restaurant downstairs seemed constantly filled with diners and while we did not try the food, the pasta did look good.Similar, yet bearing marked contrasts in theme, the family of M Boutique hotels offers a whimsical getaway at affordable prices starting at RM198.

First, we liked the room. It was very spacious, modern and clean. There are only a total of 3 floors to this property - lobby and another 2 floors for room. It looked like it was a commercial building converted into a hotel. There is nothing much to offer in terms of location and is at least 20 - 30 minutes drive to the interesting food & sights on a good day. There is a large shopping mall AEON beside it and also Tesco is about 5 minutes drive away.Our main gripe was the service. They weren't rude but it was still seriously lacking. We asked to borrow some utensils and were told to go ask the restaurant ourselves. We asked for some extra sanitary bags but were instead asked, ""Don't you have it in the room already?"" I know it's not a five stars property but I think if the staff could just put in a little effort to go the extra mile for their guests, the experience will be totally different.

The hotel reception and check-in counter is part of a modern lifestyle boutique with lots of cool clothing, home decor items and a restaurant (but it wasn't opened yet when we visited in April 2015, so I can't comment on the food).All the staff we met were very young and bubbly. They made us feel welcome from the time of arrival till the time we left.Room decor was very stylish but room size was quite small. The one we were in had no closet, although there was a rod and fancy denim hangers to hang up clothing. The bathroom was also well designed, had good water pressure and they provided the fluffiest towels I've ever used in a hotel.Hotel is conveniently located next to a mall with lots of modern shops and anchored by a Japanese departmental store and a well-stocked supermarket (AEON). Bed and pillows were comfortable. However, be prepared to hear pipe and running water noises from the surrounding rooms as the walls seems rather thin.The hotel didn't have WiFii when we stayed in April 2015. If you can't live without data, you should call ahead to check if they provide free wifi before booking.Overall, it was a great stay. Will be back :)",Aug 2015,April 2015,Couples

Firstly, checking in was a breeze. The staff was very friendly (though I didnt catch his name), and handled our 2 separate bookings smoothly. The staff would greet us by our names, which was a nice touch. Our first night was in the Cabin room. The room size is adequate, with a large bathroom. It's a room with no windows, so I won't recommend it if you're claustrophobic. The room was a little musty when we first walked in (probably because there's no window?), but got better once we turned on the a/c. The bathroom/toilet had no door, so I won't recommended it if you need privacy. Deco was monochromatic, room was tastefully decorated. It has all the standard toiletries you'd need, plus toothbrush & toothpaste. Snacks & coffee were wonderfully procured locally from Kampung Kacang Puteh (yumms) and Nanyang coffee (our new favorite coffee). As described in other reviews, you can hear people walking and talking outside of the room, probably because of the hardwood flooring (though it's a nice touch for looks). We spent the next night in the Premier room, which had a small living area with leather sofas to chill and eat kacang puteh while watching tv. Room was larger, and bathroom/toilet had doors. There's an illy espresso machine (though taste-wise, we'd prefer Nanyang coffee better), with 2 free capsules. TV channels were limited (no cartoon for kids), but it was fine for us because the kid got to watch National Geographic the entire stay and got to learn a few new things too.Location wise, it's not downtown. You'll need a car to get to places from the hotel. AEON shopping mall is right next to the hotel. Parking is by the roadside, but most of the time, it's right in front of the hotel.

It's located out of the Ipoh city center, but its a nice property with a small boutique selling some clothes, merchandize (scented candles, ties, bow ties), household items and also with a cafe on the side.The themed room was spacious and was certainly above my expectations. The queen bed was comfy and felt luxurious. The room came with some nice extras - a pair of wear-on robes and slippers, lots of pillows (2 hard and 2 soft) and a nice 2/3 seater sofa at the front of the 4 post queen bed. The room is also equipped with a small fridge, comes with some free sachets of white coffee and a bluetooth clock speaker.The toilet was great! It was fresh and nice, with four sizes of towels from big bath towels to small hankerchiefs for your usage! Toothbrushes, shampoo, shower gel and conditioner provided as well. There's a hairdryer as well. The shower had good water pressure and what else can I say? :) Free wifi for hotel guests. Pros: Big shopping mall nearby. Nice, clean and very comfy rooms. Friendly and warm staff greeting you as you arrive and when you are checking out and shopping around their boutique store.Cons: Rooms facing the road can be noisy (room is not sufficiently sound proofed. Also there is noise from the corridor when someone is walking or dragging their luggage around. Location a bit out of the city but overall not too bad.Verdict: RECOMMENDED! Will I come back? YES!

With dark colours donning the interior, the environment is highlighted with natural white flowers and even the rustic decor behind the counter, overlooking the main entrance. A bit hard to find at first since M Boutique is new but we found it in the end, even our taxi driver was in awe of the facade. Check in was smooth and easy with the help of the kind staff: Merida and Popeye (another fun thing to look forward to is the fun names they have!). Best to set aside some cash as they ask for deposit of RM100 during check in but will return it during check out. During our stay, we were informed that there was no available WiFi and breakfast which could be a bummer but we were ok with that. 3G reception is average but not a problem. Breakfast issues can be dealt with nearby eateries/restaurant as the hotel is a maximum 3 minutes walk to quite a large mall called Station 18.As for the area, there really is nothing much around in exception to S18, but we rented a car so we did go all the way to Ipoh Parade and other exciting landmarks, even accidentally visited a Hindu temple in Cheroh! If you are in for relaxing and lounging, look no further than the hotel. The room, lobby and cafe is enough to give you that relaxing mode. Or you can even go to Starbucks or do a little shopping at S18. If you want to go out of the area, I would recommend renting a car as public transport could be an issue (safety wise).Our room was AMAZING. Everything, and by everything, I mean EVERYTHING was hand crafted by M Boutique. The pillows, towels, shampoo, dental kit, basically everything was designed by the hotel. Our Queen room is big enough for 2 but can still be considered quite small on a normal scale. Despite the size, we found our room to be spacious and the details around the room kept us busy during our stay. We love the robes, the bed was comfy, the toilet was clean, TV channels were good. However, an issue I found was the thin walls. I can hear people walking or bringing their luggage even when I was sleeping. This could be trouble for the light sleepers, but it proved harmless during our stay. The safe in our room was not working as well so we did find it troubling to leave our passports and money in our luggage.Food at the Myth Cafe, was alright if not good. Overpriced for its quality of taste but I suppose the interior design and plating made up for it. Tentative staff, but not quite knowledgeable on the menu as we had hope. The cafe is always full with non-guests but again, we had no trouble finding a good table for dinner.We did request for a hotel transfer to the Ipoh train station and it was RM27 nett. The car used was the staff's car so maybe in the future we hope there could be a more proper designated transport. It feels more safe to have a staff drive you as we left the hotel at around 4.15 AM and on the way there were some racing activities which was apparently very dangerous, especially if you did not know your way around. Pro's:-great design and concept-helpful, kind and funny staff-near to Station 18-clean-good value for moneyCon's:-thin walls-safe not working-location -no breakfast-no WiFi (for now)-some of the food on the menuOverall, it was a great stay and experience for us and we would definitely recommend this place to our friends and family (what we've been doing ever since coming back!)",May 2015,May 2015,Couples

From the stylish lobby, to stylish walk through between rooms and of course, their signature rooms. Understand the hotel is still very new. I was there with my dear friend to experience a night in M Boutique after visiting their neighbor cafe ""MYTH Espresso Bar"" a week ago. Didn't blame them for the lack of WiFi as I was told before hand, but after going thru M Boutique's Website, they shouldn't stated it as one of it's facilities in the website before it's ready. Many guest would have complain about this issue as not many guest would understand the lack of facilities during a hotel soft/pre-opening. We were appointed the Queen Room upon booking. Wish to try their Premier King Suite one day soon when they are ready. The Queen Room. I've not visited the first M Boutique which is in the center of Ipoh. Gotta be honest, for people who appreciates art and the uniqueness of a boutique hotel, you'll like this hotel a lot. Love the idea of showing each type of room ""The Queen Room"" in a box of light. The room, well, it is small in size no doubt of that. Nevertheless, comfort is what we felt throughout the stay. Probably the centerpiece of the room would be the bathroom. Contrast Bathroom I named it. Although an idea of displaying some of the home fragrance would be nice as they are available to purchase at their lobby. (Me myself got the Lavender Essential Oil) a week ago before staying here for a night, it was lovely. The room placement is a little odd. Perhaps this is because of the size of the room, but it is what you saw as the website. There's not much of cons during my stay except for some stains in the toilet which I didn't report it on the spot. There are some ""p*e"" stains still outside the toilet bowl. Being someone who usually reviews a hotel after a stay, I have a habit to perform a check through with the room before settling myself in. Stains as mentioned is not acceptable as rooms should be clean at least 99% before the next guest check in. This is still a new hotel, there are some noticeable dust around the decors in room, and the curtains needs to be dust from time to time. Another thing to mention is, when a hotel staff uses the guest lift, he or she should let the hotel guest walk out first before themselves. Also, a nice carpet with M Boutique Logo would be nice to place inside the small lift =) The bed was unexpectedly good. I've been to small boutique hotels (non-luxury standards) with standard pillows and bed. In M Boutique you'll find Goose Down pillows which is rare, especially with the given room rate. M Boutique is truly an unique experience. I will be back for sure to try their Premier King Suite.",May 2015,May 2015,Couples

A subtle warmth in my soul comes over me at my previous nights at M Boutique Hotel.M Boutique Hotel isn't without complaint - what place isn't really though when one thinks about it.  There is a ridiculously noisy bar across the street.  The rooms are small - not great for business travelers like me.  And, unfortunately, the eatery attached to M Boutique has let its standards slip since they opened.  All in all, I am merely nitpicking as the overall experience that Mr. Lloyd and his crew put together is excellent.But M Boutique Hotel isn't enough apparently in Ipoh.Enter M Boutique Station 18, located right next to Aeon mall - Ipoh's largest mall . . .

The recipe is simple: take the great personalized service and family atmosphere, sprinkle in some touches in design and decor that are sure to make one at ease and comfy, add larger size rooms with better functionality, mix it up by placing it next to Ipoh's biggest mall and surrounded by local shops/restaurants, and stir it all together with an excellent cafe (Myth Espresso Bar) run by Chef Alan who turns out mouth watering food served by his extremely attentive staff.
