Good for a single or couple stay for short term trip. There are chinese, western, and japanese surrounding the area. The hotel lobby is equipped with Snooker tables and Virtual Pinball machines which you can use for MYR 2 per game. The top floor hallway is very hot and lack of air circulation, they always close the window.

Although, the water heater was not working in our room, the receptionist allowed us to use other room for shower. Additionally, if the price could be a bit lower,  it would be more reasonable.

Growing up in a small town isn’t easy. Ever since I’ve move out from Kampar when I was very young, I’ve been expose to many Boutique hotels especially luxury ones and lately I’m into those chic hotels. It’s only a night stay here and I book myself the suite instead of the standard rooms. This isn’t my first stay with M Boutique, and actually we check out from Station 18 then checking into Kampar. The suite in Kampar has a more modern interior but different. I like the design, but there are so much more the management can do. For example, there’s two bedside table - why only put one lamp? There’s an empty corner - why not a standing lamp? There’s a nice long couch - why not a coffee table? :-) Upon check in, as usual I had to check all corners of the room. The room was filthy. Covered with dust, hairs on the floor, bathroom tiles were oily and the room safe isn’t working. I’m guessing the Hotel is running low of staff so I ask the lady from the reception to come up and I showed her the dusty shelves and dirty floor. We went out for lunch afterwards but room was clean at the end in the evening which is good. Room safe isn’t working still though. Would I come back again, yes. My guess the room had low occupancy and no one had stay for a period of time because it’s “Kampar”. But rooms should be inspect before any guest check in, this is still a fairly new hotel. Next time, do inspect the rooms first. Friends stayed at the standard rooms and it was decent as well. No windows, but the bathroom idea was genius.",Dec 2017,December 2017,Solo

Both the ambience and design of the hotel was really cool. It was hipster, new and interesting. However, the horrible service made me severely sad. I booked this hotel via agoda and thus, even before arriving I have already paid for my hotel. Common sense states that, I don't owe this hotel a single cent anymore. Thus, when I arrived at the hotel, I was surprised to find that I had to pay a deposit of RM100 which was refundable. I have nothing against this policy. However, I was shocked that I have to do that. Because as a person who have paid everything, one would expect zero cash transaction.I been to many other hotels and although they have this policy, they just charged on my credit card after asking for my permission. I find that still alright because atleast no real cash transaction happened. What if I had no cash in my hand for the hotel? Some hotels even outright no longer have this sort of policies.I just wished I was told before I arrived. Be it in an email or a notice. Just a heads up so I can prepare myself. The staff that told me about this was very rude. I was tired from my trip so I didn't want to argue or anything but I was certainly pissed.I noticed a writing at the front door that they close it after 11pm and you will require your room card to enter, thus I asked for one as I only have one. I intended to go to a cafe later while my family wanted to stay in and watched tv. The staff rudely told me that there isn't any extra card and that the front desk would be open. I disliked her rude attitude, so I decided not to go to a cafe and just stayed in. I am absolutely appalled with the service here.

The staff at the concierge tries to be efficient but check in took such a long time despite the fact that I have already made full paymeny via Agoda. System network slow the staff claimed. After finally waiting for quite some time to process my check in, was rather disappointing to find the room was merely ordinary as compared to what was shown on the Agoda. Bathroom tiles are old, stained and mouldy. Bedsheet and pillow cases stained and tainted. Wifi is very bad. And worst of all, the swimming pool that the locals boast so much about this hotel is closed down. Oh well. Since the pool is closed so tried to watch TV in the room instead. Poor reception in the room that the TV programmes was halted a few times. Haven't try the breakfast for tomorrow morning yet but let's hope it is not lame too. Fingers crossed.

Mediocre I'd say, however it did include an egg station, baked beans as well as noodles, bread, jam and fruit. Buffet style. Rooms? Large, very large. The bathroom too, perfectly adequate.

Kampar is really a tale of two towns. The old town which is crammed full of traditional Chinese shop houses, peeling paintwork, oozing atmosphere and a chap sitting outside the barber shop who looks as though he may not have shifted position in the last forty years. My tip - spend at least a whole day wandering round eating at various venues and taking photos! This town started to die in the 80s when the tin mines ceased operating and was almost killed off when the North-South highway turned it from a waypoint on the long drive to Penang, into a sleepy backwater as it became completely bypassed in the 90s. Enter UNITAR (University TAR) which brought thousands of students, hundreds of staff and support workers and a reinvigoration of the local economy. Kampar New Town was born on the site of the old mine and with it came this hotel. Big rooms, comfortably furnished, helpful and friendly staff day and night, adequate though not spectacular breakfast, but a very good in-house Chinese restaurant. RM130++ per night B+B was a real bargain. I would definitely recommend, whether for business stopover or as a base for exploring Perak and seeing a Malaysian town as it was 40-50 years ago.

In fact the only decnt hotel in Kampar. Kapmapr itself is a very small and sleepy town in Perak, which owes its reawakening to the new campus for the University of Tenku Abdul Rahman (UTAR).The hotel is just about the only high rise structure in the area with a very attractive facade that is a clearly recognizable landmark from quite a distance.  Surrounding the hotel is a sleepy rows of shops which may or not choose to be open when you need something. There is enough variety of eating places so you will never go hungry. There is a MacDonalds just 5mins away and a convenience store just nearby.The hotel is still relatively new so everything looks fairly fresh and in working condition. Given Malaysian tendency for things to run down quickly, I hope that things will remain as is for sometime. Furnishings are not luxurious but simple and functional. Room is comfortable and very quiet (no traffic in Kampar!). All conveniences are available including free LAN internet in the rooms and free wifi in the public areas. There is even a small gym (just treadmill and cycle. No weights).Service is very friendly and prompt. The complimentary buffet breakfast is however quite pathetic. I was staying there in an off-peak, and as there were few guests, the breakfast fare for appeared to have been sitting there for many days in a row.All in all I think decent value for money. I would be happy to stay there again.",Feb 2012,February 2012,Business

Located in Bandar Baru Kampar ie. new part of Kampar town, easily distinguishable by its palace-like facade with roof architecture resembling a cathedral or resort in the ""happiest place on earth"". Parking plentiful at front & back, all free! We were given a standard deluxe room roomy enough for 2 single beds + 1 extra. Could fit another single bed for a family/larger group with sufficient walking space. Bathroom was ok - shower tiles a little grimy; water flow tended to end up on floor possibly due to design or construction problem. However, shower strength was excellent and made up for shortfalls (all's well so long as shower head is aimed in correct direction). Had a challenge taming the airconditioning unit as airflow was so strong, could feel it even at furthest corner of room even when set at its lowest. TV entertainment a limited choice betw local & satellite channels. Else hang around the lobby & tap into the free wifi.About 30 of us sat down on a long table for ""banana leaf rice"" dinner - waiters moved around serving rice/meat/curry/condiments/etc. Plenty to choose from but tasted better ones in KL. Coffee house was probably not the right atmosphere to savour this fare as it's meant to be eaten in an authentic Indian curry house, hot & sweaty all the way. Buffet b'fast so-so.. probably get better & cheap enough food at the many coffee shops nearby. Else a 5-min stroll to the golden arches for those needing their fastfood fix...Used one of the function rooms for our event - spacious and clean. With restrooms at the rear, minimised disruption with ppl going in & out. Apparently there was a swimming pool & gym at rooftop but didn't get a chance to use them. Our party made full use of the sports complex next door - covered tennis court + futsal.Visited a nearby church (2mins drive, 5mins walk) for Sunday service - Calvary City Church. Small yet energetic congregation courtesy of nearby campus (UTAR & TAR college).Check-in and check-out was smooth, attentive & polite staff. All in all, good value for money as the hotel caters well to nature lovers (caving, whitewater rafting, lighthouse, etc nearby), stopovers as well as visitors to the nearby tertiary institutions. Short drive from the old town for those seeking some nostalgia & traditional eats (chicken bread, steamed buns, noodles, etc).",Nov 2011,November 2011,Friends

What struck us was the ultra-cleanliness of the rooms and the bathrooms.  The food at the cafe and restaurant at the hotel is ok, just passable, IF you are starving.  While the reception, housekeeping staff, and the bell hops are very friendly, the cafe and restaurant staff need a lot of ""upgrading"".  The cafe staff hardly understand English, and we were served with some food that was going off, but upon complaining, no effort was made to exchange it.  We were instead asked to fill out a complain form.  If we had got food poisoning?  No restaurant should let a complaint like bad food go unattended to immediately.  Perhaps the hotel needs to give their staff, and some managers, proper training in dealing with customers?    With the hotel getting popular due to their marketing strategy, we have found that it is getting noisy in the nights and with more new staff added over the past few months the service is going down.We have stayed at this hotel a few times over the past few months, but it is more due to the cleanliness of the rooms.",Apr 2011,March 2011,Business
