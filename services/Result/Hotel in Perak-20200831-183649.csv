I understand that the Malaysian government has put in place certain measures due to Covid-19 and that has caused some hotels to decide to refuse new bookings until 31st March.The way I see it. Louis Hotel accepted my booking. If the hotel did not want to accept new bookings, then they should have updated their system to do so. Secondly, I did not receive any messages from the hotel to say that they were going to cancel the booking. There is a messaging facility on booking.com for hotels to contact guests. The hotel had 2 days to message me, but did not do so.Thirdly, I know that Louis Hotel had my mobile number. The reception had my reservation form and I could see my mobile contact number written on it.The hotel had at least 2 ways to contact me to let me know that the booking was cancelled, but failed in this basic courtesy. Instead, they let me travel from nearly 300km for no reason.Incidentally, the hotel is located right opposite the wet market.

Well, no regrets as the hotel is located strategically in the middle of the town, so restaurants, Taiping Mall, market, hawker stalls, varieties of shops were just within walking distance.The hotel provides free parking coupons for the guests and the staffs were friendly and helpful, they were quick to response too.The first thing that I wasn't really happy with was the strong smell of the smoke in my room. Whilst there was a ""no smoking"" sign displayed, I guess the hotel can't really control if the guests smoke in the room (I chose the Deluxe King, which came with a balcony); but the hotel was quick to respond when I called to highlight this to them and they put an air cleaning device in the room.The stay was quite comfortable although the size for the room is rather small for a Deluxe King. The air conditioner was working fine. The bathroom was a little small though, when we shower water will splash almost the whole bathroom but they do provide the rain showerhead, which was quite an enjoyment, especially after a sweaty day.I would say the sound proofing was very poor. I guess my room was just next to the store room where the staffs have access to the tools. I was taking a nap at noon and during housekeeping, I could hear the sound of the door being ""slammed"" continuously for almost an hour, hence disturbing my nap. Also, I can hear voices of guests walking along the corridor.I would still say that this is a good stay and the hotel deserves a good rating despite the few drawbacks that I've mentioned above.Oh yes, no toileteries were provided, so guests need to bring their own :)",Oct 2016,October 2016,Solo

It is located within a 5-7 minute walk of the major Tau Sa Piah (biscuit) shops which is also where a number of Ipoh's famous beansprout chicken rice and moonlight noodle stalls are. At night, the fact that it is walking distance helps, as the area turns into a largely pedestrian only thoroughfare with tourists and locals descending on the night markets and hawker centers and various other restaurants. We found the walk there safe and the people we interacted with were, as typical of our experience in Ipoh, very genial.We also loved, on a rainy day, not having to walk too far to sample out of this world popiah and quite extraordinary Rojak made by a 90 year old uncle at the hawker center behind the hotel. It was the sort of place we would never have known to go to had we stayed anywhere else in Ipoh and we were thankful to Debbie for having recommended it to us.You will need a car to get to the touristy parts of Ipoh including Little India, across the Kinta river and/or the malls although the hotel can help with calling an Uber/cab etc.  (As an aside, try to make a breakfast trip to Kedai Kopi Ah Chow to have very good, very old school wantan mee with cha siu, made by a young man and his wife. We made two trips there during our stay and it received the kids' culinary seal of approval too.) We stayed in the Family Suite which comfortably held my parents, kids and I in an enormous oversized King bed and a very comfortable sofa (double bed). The kids loved the bed and the TV and as Debbie, the innkeeper predicted,  often chose to stay in and enjoy the amenities of the room and accompanying bath instead of venturing out in the middle of the day.The bathroom is nicely appointed as was the dressing area (yes, the room has one). Security is very reassuring and provided all through the night. It was quite lovely to sit in the foyer/lounge in the early mornings as the streets around the hotel awaken. At that time, I would recommend getting a teh tarik from the coffeehouse up the street (the rest of the morning menu was just alright).But what we enjoyed the most about Bedrock was the tireless hospitality of Debbie and Mr Chong, the innkeepers, Mr Yee at the front desk and the housekeeping staff. I watched as they fielded questions from an array of visitors with aplomb making each one feel very special, individually attended to and well taken care of - and that too, over the very busy Christmas period last year (2018). It is a skill and a calling my whole party appreciated. My vegetarian dad in particular appreciated their consideration in ensuring all their restaurant recommendations were for places with good vegetarian options. Ipoh is a very laid back town and a little bit of a throw back to a simpler time. The more you discover it, you will find areas and pockets you will want to return to on a second visit.For the first visit though, I am hard pressed to find a better place to situate yourself, to get a feel for the place and to experience its hospitality.",Aug 2019,December 2018,Families

However, the quality of the Family Suite really disappointed me. Your mileage may vary, but this review in particular is for families with young children. General Safety. The room was not well thought out with no permanent closing door for the toilet (I know this is not the case for the other rooms, but I stayed in the Family Suite). This meant that my 1 year old could easily run up and down into the toilet and I spent most of the holiday ensuring he didn't enter - he eventually did and slipped on the wet floor. When I highlighted this problem, the manager was surprised that this was a problem - I am surprised it hadn't been an issue before. The other thing is that there is no additional security latch on the door. This would be standard for most hotels in Malaysia. This means that for families with children who are experimenting with opening doors - the kid can absolutely open them even if you have 'locked' them! Once again, the manager was clueless as to this.General Cleanliness. The room was also not well cleaned prior to our arrival. The odd stain here and there as well as the permanent overhang of dust from the MANY and REDUNDANT carpets was awful. It didn't feel like they had vacuumed the room often and my allergies really acted up when I was in the room - and was fine when I went out into town. When we arrived back in the room in the late afternoons, there would also be the strong smell of cigarette smoke - we surmised probably one of the staff were smoking in the adjourning stairwell.  Overall, this room was way more trouble than it was worth. And it was one of the more pricey hotels in Ipoh!",Jun 2019,June 2019,Families

This hotel has been put together with great attention to detail and with real style , the owners really want all guests to feel welcome and at home. As part of our trip we wanted to explore the Cameron Highlands from Ipoh and really struggled to find a suitable driver / guide via the internet. We asked if the hotel could help and they found us a trusted local guide who was excellent ( his name is Visva , he speaks excellent english and has a new 7 seater vehicle / contact via whats app on +60195569646 . He listened to what we wanted to see and avoided the more touristy places and showed us sights not highlighted by our internet searches). We travelled as a couple and really enjoyed our stay . Would highly recommend a stay at Bedrock , we will certainly return on our next trip to Malaysia .",Feb 2019,February 2019,Couples

There was also a Nespresso coffee machine, a dispenser for unlimited cold drinking water (and warm and Malays often prefer to drink warm water), complimentary fruit and popcorn in the room plus some soft drinks in the fridge that were also complimentary.The breakfast, while naturally not having the range of bigger and more expensive hotels, was perfectly adequate. There was tea or coffee, orange juice, cereals, pastries etc, and the offer of eggs, sausage and hash browns or the Malaysian breakfast of nasi lemak (coconut rice with a tamarind sauce, fried anchovies, peanuts, sliced cucumber and a hard-boiled egg).

The hotel is a short walk from an area full of outdoor local restaurants. On the other hand, there were some minor things that could be improved. For example, the breakfast was rather uninspiring. On our second morning, we opted to skip it, and one of the staff agreed that he also gets bored with the selection. The hotel also provided a small amount of free refreshments in our room. That was a nice gesture. But they only gave us one small bottle of Coke -- even though there were two of us. This is not a complaint. After all, they didn't have to give anything free to us at all. It just seemed that, if they were going to bother providing complimentary beverages, they should at least give one per guest. But again, these are just two minor points.

We wanted another popular hotel which was sold out and my hubs suggested this after going through few other choices.LocationAs we brought our little one with us, location is important as it needs to be nearby restaurants, mall and few other stuff that we usually shop for snacks to bring home whenever we are on day trip or few days stay. Bedrock's location is so strategic that it's about 400m away from the popular chicken rice restaurants, snacks, tau foo fa and many more. As for Kong Heng, a 2 min drive is required as it's located slightly further down from Lou Wong side.For food, Impressive Restaurant is behind the hotel within 100m walk and they have some popular food which we didn't get to try except curry chee cheong fun due to our late lunch after 2pm.ParkingParking is one of my top priority knowing that as long as we are in Ipoh town, parking is extremely difficult to get, be it working day and worst still, when it's school or public holiday. Thankfully, they have few reserved spots in front of their hotel and if you are unable to find one, just park around the hotel and they will pay for your parking.Exterior HotelIt's located in shoplots, and therefore, there's only 2 floors, excluding ground floor with 10 rooms available. There's a small cafe for them to serve breakfast to the guests and seating/ waiting area and reception for customers to relax while checking-in.I'd say the hotel is contemporary and still have the touches of antique cum artsy fill with sculptures. Hotel is well-maintained and I know, for a fact that their finishing still exude the high quality compared to some boutique hotels that I've stayed in Penang which tries to look contemporary but poor quality finishing.RoomI've booked the Executive Deluxe and it's huge and we were impressed by the space and that my little one can still run around without any problem. I've not had this kind of room that big for the price I've paid and even those 4 or 5 stars hotels room size ain't that big and double the price. Trust me, once you have to place a cot in the room, I found there's still ample space for us to walk around unlike all the hotels we have stayed for past few years. Wow, this the first time I've seen a hotel, be it boutique or upper hotels installing Coway water dispenser. This is super helpful for parents with infant. I didn't have to boil any water cuz it's ready and it was ready whenever I need to prepare the milk, especially middle of the night.Other little things that they've thought of is having an ironing board, hairdryer, laundry bag, bedroom slipper, Nespresso machine and mini toiletry kits.

From the moment we entered the Hotel, we knew we had made the right choice.  Stylish, very comfortable, personal and friendly, close to everything, yet at a very reasonable price.  Having traveled quite extensively these years, we are getting increasingly uncomfortable with the ""free bottled water"" provided by hotels, esp in hot places.  We avoided taking those as far as we could and every time when we left a hotel we just hoped the untouched ones were not being thrown away by the housekeeping.  We either boil and fill up our own bottles, amid scary stories about in-room boiling pots, or do the job at breakfast, when usually distilled water is made available.  The fact that Bedrock has an in-room water purifier is such a great plus that I think every hotel should be doing the same, or at least at each floor, rather than dispensing bottles of water which is utterly eco-unfriendly.A real shame that we were only in Ipoh for one night on transit to Penang.  If we ever visit Ipoh again we will definitely return to Bedrock.",Sep 2018,September 2018,Couples

Hard and soft pillows so can choose which best preferred.So comfortable that we missed breakfast timing 7am to 10am. Chef was there waiting to prepare our bfast at 10.10am. Food served hot. I simply LOVED HOT FOOD. Especially hashbrowns, I was at the other hotel and I was so sad having cold hashbrowns.. Bedrock served nice food and can be top up upon request. This is great idea to reduce food wastage, saving environment as well.Saw fruits are available. Previously there were reviews no fruits, seems like they have taken action and treated reviews seriously ok! Bananas, apples,oranges are available at breakfast table. Yummy crossaints and orange juice too.Security guard available after 10pm outside hotel to guard guests'cars. Debbie prepared maps to guide us on visiting places of interest and good food. From checkin to room to service to sleep to food to checkout, seriously, I have no complaints! Cons: Really nothing much to improve cos it is already at top notch.

The Hotel was newly opened in April 17 and we decided on this choice after reading the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We were met on arrival at the airport by Mr Chong, the owner and had a short smooth ride to the Hotel. Upon arrival at the Hotel, we were warmly greeted by his wife, Debbie, who checked us in and gave us a very thorough walk of the Hotel amenities as well as the sights and food of Ipoh. She answered all our anxious queries about Ipoh and it‚Äôs surroundings and our plan for our stay here. Thereafter she printed a map of the Old Town, places and museum to see and in particular, marked out all the food places as we told her our main objective was to eat ‚Äòtil we drop‚Äô as Ipoh is such a Foodie paradise. Although Bedrock is located in new town, it is still within walking distance of the historic Old Town and about 10 mins walk to the largest mall in Ipoh. It‚Äôs also convenient to book an Uber and the ride is only about RM3. There were many eateries near the Hotel including the famous ‚ÄòNga choi kai‚Äô, a delicious tau fu fa shop at the back lane and many shops selling the famous biscuits and delicacies. The deluxe room we had was large, well furnished and luxurious. Ladies would love the table for writing cum vanity with a large mirror and even a vanity mirror on it. The super king bed was luxurious and nicely firm and I especially liked the bolster, an item that I seldom find even in 5 star resorts. The TV in the room had a good section of channels including the Sports channel. The Nespresso machine with its complimentary pods and the Coway filtered water dispenser for hot/cold water were very much appreciated. Debbie & Chong were the perfect host who made our stay most memorable. Debbie greeted us daily and helped us with our plans for the day. Both went the extra mile to assist us and took care of us, so we were never bored at any time. We travelled widely around the world and we usually select the small and cosy hotels that were managed by the owners as we find them most knowledgeable about the area and extremely passionate about helping their guests.

It used to be the centre of the now defunct Malaysian tin-mining industry and has re-invented itself as a destination for its food and historical buildings.We stayed Sunday 5 November night at the Bedrock Hotel, a less than a year old boutique hotel converted from two shophouses. Its lattice facade of overlapping square wooden frames of various sizes over a dark green exterior made the hotel stood out among its more mundane neighbours. We were met upon arrival by Debbie, one of the two owners. She and her staff had us all checked in and upon our request, she gave us a thorough run through of what‚Äôs good and where. Really appreciated her warm welcome and exuberance. Bedrock Hotel was just a 10 minute walk to Nga Choi Kei (Beansprout chicken) street, Jalan Yat Tet Shin, for which Ipoh was famous. It was a street of eateries and traditional Chinese confectioneries.The lounge and reception areas were spacious, open and wheels-friendly with ramp access for wheeled luggages and wheelchairs. Behind it was a small dining area where breakfast was served. I didn‚Äôt explore what‚Äôs beyond the dining area but I understood there were meeting rooms.Bedrock has only 10 rooms, each good sized, tastefully furnished, well equipped and could outshine quite a few of the 5-star international hotels. Each room came with free wifi, a wall-mounted tv, a bar fridge, a Nespresso coffee machine with free coffee capsules, and a filtered water dispenser supplying room, hot and cold water depending on one‚Äôs choice, beside the usual beverage supplies.Small touches like adjustable reading lights on the bed headboard, remote control lighting, well-placed and sufficient wall sockets for charging electronic devices, and best of all, a specially designed holder which fitted snuggedly the remote control units for the lights, tv and air conditioning, all went to enhance the guest‚Äôs experience. The ensuite bathroom came with quality fittings, two wash basins, a glass enclosed shower and a bathtub. One thoughtful feature which our ladies loved was the availability of more hooks than the usual one or two of most hotels.Throughout the hotel and some rooms were mounted displays of scholar rocks or stones (gongshi). These were stones which occurred naturally or were shaped naturally over time which the early Chinese scholars appreciated. Those gongshi on display in the hotel belonged to the owners‚Äô family collection and added a traditional touch to the Bedrock‚Äôs modern chic.Breakfast was included in the room charge. We had a decent breakfast of fried eggs, ham, hash brown, baked beans, toast, juice and coffee which was local ground coffee served in the traditional cup and saucer for which Ipoh was famous for. Certainly appreciate the staff effort to have our breakfast ready before their usual opening hours.Upon leaving the hotel on checkout, the hotel staff lined up outside the hotel entrance to wave goodbye to us, a really nice gesture! I for one will definitely be back!",Nov 2017,November 2017,Friends

I think there is an in-room sensing device that monitors if people are in the room or not, and adjusts the air conditioning accordingly.

Loved the passionate and friendly service mindset of the owners who were forthcoming with recommendations and places to visit and eat at. We had a great meal at one of his recommendations. The hotel is very new and has only 10 rooms. No expenses were spared and the renovations were of a high standard. They were able to blend in their family collection of unique rocks with the furnishings in the hotel. This new boutique hotel is styled with a mix of contemporary Chinese and Western details. It was also featured in CNN travel. Upon check in, our pastor and his wife were upgraded to a suite at no extra cost. The rooms were very spacious and fitted with Nespresso coffee machines and Coway water purifier, a first for us who are quite seasoned travellers. The specially imported bed was so comfortable with bolsters provided and the bathroom was also spacious with double vanities and a bathtub with a separate shower. Location was ideal as we were only a few minutes to the popular eateries. Breakfast was adequate with cooked to order eggs and sausages. The rate we paid was very reasonable and it was great value.

CONS- don't expect too much on the room. it is just average with basic needs- breakfast - need to improve on services. no spoons and it took some time to get it.also not so much varieties. overall, it is a good place to stay for a night or two. peaceful, surrounded with greens and palm trees. easy access from KL with just driving. also comes with good price",Jan 2020,January 2020,None

And there's nowhere else to eat for probably 40km, maybe 60! So bring lots of snacks... We ordered dinner from their bare menu. The cooks should stick to local fare if that's what they're good at. The breakfast buffet was just acceptable. Still, I love a hotel that is more than just a building or a room. This place with its vast expanse of greenery is certainly a refreshing change to the hustle and bustle of city life.",Jun 2017,July 2016,Couples

Kitchen is halal only. The 3 room villa that we stayed is villa unit 6 & 7, it consist of 3 bedroom withe ensuite bathroom and a living and a fully equipped kitchen / dining area. The car porch infront can park 3 car. The villa is good in condition and suitable for group of friends or family to stay together. More over the Jacuzzi which is situated in the middle provides more privacy . Overall condition of the villa is good, only some of the lock on the sliding glass door is unlockable, living aircon is leaking on the next morning and the fridge not too cold.On the other hand, the 1 room villa is situated at a more secluded location, which resulted more insects at the jacuzzi area and in the bathroom. 1 room.villa come with a big bathtub at the bathroom and a large living. Downside is the area is too huge but only 1 aircon in the bedroom and living is only having fan which resulted the villa quite warm on the day time.

It was great!  The resort must have once been a thriving tourist destination, but it was actually very quiet when we were there. There were quite a few people using the hot springs, but the resort only had a handful of guests.  We had a ground floor (there are are two levels) adjoining rooms - queen and two singles.  The rooms were huge - linen was all new, very clean, tvs with all channels, fridges, tea & coffee, large bathrooms. I was very impressed.Breakfast wasnt too bad. There were plenty of options, but I think with not many guests staying there wasn't much effort put into the food on offer.Once at the hotel, there are no other options for food for lunch and dinner other than the restaurant.  There are a few food vendors in the hot springs areas, but as it is not busy (possibly low season?) they were closed.  Which was fine, because we ate dinner and spent approximately $20 for all 4 of us.Take note - there is no alcohol served here. If you would like a drink - bring your own to keep in your room.  As for the pools - they were great. The kids loved them. There was a warm pool, a large cool pool with fountains and slides, therapy pools, and even an egg boiling pool!You will need to arrange transport in and out yourself. We caught a private taxi from KL there, which cost us 350MYR (approx $115) for an hour and a half drive. I had checked on Trip Advisor and other blogs on the best way to get from there to Tanah Rata but found out once we got there the information was outdated. The hotel called a taxi for us to get to Tapah where we could get a bus to Tanah Rata. That taxi cost 70MYR (approx $23) and it was the most run down and dangerous taxi I have ever been in!!  We also waited at the bus for a while before being told that the buses don't run any more and we would have to go to the taxi stand - another 130MYR to get to Tanah Rata.

Down side about this park is the poorly maintain toilet facilities and changing room. Along the broadway walk, there is a small shelter built right above the hot steaming stream. If you wish to do an open air hot steam, this is a good place to try it out. Surprisingly, I bumped into many korea family and communities. I think if korean can make it to this place, i think  Malaysian should come more often and support this place. Overall, it is a bit costly for a day trip but for family time, it is priceless.

You need to pass through village and palm oil plantation to reach the hot spring. Parkings available and buggy picked up and dropped customers to the resort.We went to the cold pool with slides, children' favourite. Beside the enjoyment, parents please closely look after your kids, especially when they played somewhere near the slides. there were at least 2 accidents that I witnessed, kids stood very near to the spot where people slide down and got badly hit. Many kids and youngsters were not safety conscious, kept urging my sons to slide down before the previous kid reached the end of slide. Well, my son was smart enough to block and slide down only when he thought was safe. Many kids/youngsters slide down in a row causing some of them drinking some pool water when trying to catch some air, while many showed off their stunt which i would definitely scold ""Are you trying to break your neck or backbone!"" if my son did that.The hot spring was much more peaceful compared to the cold pool. I spotted many Raja Brookes butterflies by the pool. Its usually very difficult to see them so clearly, too bad my camera was in locker. The hot spring was very good for skin. If you so happened to have a little rashes on skin, you would feel much better after the hot spring. ahh, most importantly, the resort was really green and not really hot, it was really an enjoyable hot spring experience.The interesting part was cooking egg with hot spring water, 10 minutes for hard-boiled.

I was resting when suddenly someone from other room 'mistakenly' opens the door that goes straight into my room.

Not the hot springs.I was looking for a nice but inexpensive place for a surprise birthday treat earlier this month and remembered this place. A couple years back, a bunch of girlfriends and I booked a villa for a bachelorette party. It was fun so I thought I'd visit again as a couple.  I first booked online via Agoda and changed my plan a few times as I was considering other places as well. In the end, I phoned the hotel and booked directly. It wasn't hard to get through and the room rate can be cheaper than online too.Booking - Online and phone available. Booking directly with the hotel might help you get the room that is not listed or sold out on partners' sites.Rate - Fair. RM180/night for deluxe roomLocation - Good. The hot spring park is right next door. Tourists will need car to get to the hotel as the hotel is in a village about 9km drive from the highway exit.Dining - FREE breakfast included. Tasty buffet with quite a good selection. Felda IS known for their delicious food y'know. Service - Front desk staff were friendly and very helpful. Excellent!Check-in was a breeze. Paid and got the room key. Yes key but that's okay. Staff was patient in answering my questions and I even had the front desk girl to help me book massages at the spa.Note: If you book the villa, you gotta go back to your car and drive out of the compound, turn right at the gate and go towards the hot spring park. The villas are further down the road. Deluxe room spacious and well-equipped if you don't look too closely- I found the hairdryer broken. It could be cleaner and maintained better though. Found lizard droppings on table and roach in the bathroom. I got room number 1 and the door lock was not exactly broken but we had to figure it out a bit, so that could use a repair. Is it worth a visit? Yes if you don't have high expectation and going with good friends and family (so they can distract you from the little flaws).Hotel management should really invest in some maintenance/repair/refurbishment before the place become a total dump.Longer review including of spa, coffee house, hot springs and more pictures in my blog - sheasoniashares.blogspot.com",Jun 2015,April 2015,Couples

It's a really nice getaway that's close to nature.  Unfortunately, the upkeep of the place is not kept up.  Indoors: there were burnt out light bulbs and broken blinds in the TV room, broken chaise lounge in room 1, no wash cloths and hand towels in the bathrooms, rugs not vacuumed and cleaned, a missing air-conditioner remote, scorch mark on wall in the kitchenette area not painted, dirt in corners of the rooms and on kitchen counters, the light in the refrigerator wasn't functional, no tea towel and dish cloth in the kitchenette, insufficient information about the facilities  and amenities in the room.  Outdoors: Could not locate the valves to operate the outdoor jacuzzi tub.  There was garden debris in the tub, the lounge chairs not cleaned and the drains clogged with leaves. There were insufficient signs on how to get to the villas from the lobby area.  Information and map were not provided until asked for.

The shuttle tram to the various pools on the property are apparently only for the general public as the use of it was not included in the room rates.  The one tram driver we asked was rude.  The mountain springs pool was filthy in the deeper end - the water was murky and full of algae.  The main hot springs pool was a little better.  The signs warning visitors and guests of possible contamination and illness from using the pools were not reassuring.  There could be better signage and information about the flora in the area.

The resort is located in the hot spring area. We booked 2 villas and 2 hotel rooms. Each guests were given 2 day pass to the hot spring pools. However, this pass did not allow you to take the shuttle that transport guests from the ticket counter to the hot spring pool area and vice versa.  This was rather weird to me as we would have to pay for the ride. However, it didn't bother me as it was only a 10 minute slow walk.The check in time is 3pm and we arrived early. We were not allowed to go into our rooms nor villas as it was a public holiday and many guests were checking out. The reception hall is naturally ""naturally cooled"" by fans and I was not impressed with the decorations, at all. However, the grass in the hotel compound was very neatly trimmed, and it was very clean. My initial disappointment started to fade a little and my hope for the quality of the rooms and villas started to rise again.Let's look at the hotel rooms first. They were all located adjacent to the reception hall. They were big equipped with queen size bed and a tiny old school TV. There was a stain on the bed sheet but other than that, the room was clean and no foul odour. Toilet and bathroom was small compared to the size of the room and the bathtub did not come with shower curtain. So every shower you take will guarantee to wet the floor. But i can live with that as it was clean, hot water was instantly available, and the water pressure was strong. The bed quality is nothing out of the ordinary but nonetheless, it was ok for me. The only thing that bothered me was that it was quite old and minor touch ups/renovations would definitely made the stay more pleasurable. As for the villas, now this is where the resort shines! They were all located a short drive away, if one did not have the intention to walk from the reception hall. The villas that we booked were 4 bedrooms to each villa. The cars of the guests were given special pass to access the exclusive drive way to the villas. Security was quite tight as they only allow cars with pass to enter. The landscaping of this area was clean, green and well kept. Inside the villa, the rooms were big as well. It features kitchen, dining hall and a living hall. Decoration in the living room was contemporary, comfortable and large enough to accommodate 20 of us. More importantly, each villa has its own hot spring Jacuzzi pool, and it was very nicely designed! The hotel room quality should match the quality of the villa, in my opinion. Oh, did i mention that the layout of the other villa were different? One villa had the Jacuzzi pool located in the back of the villa, while another villa has the pool located right in the center of the villa. Very interesting! The buffet breakfast was included, but it was nothing to shout about. The usual bread, cornflakes, and local delicacies. Selections were limited and the quality of the food was normal.Despite a little of short comings, we did enjoy our stay. I would give 5 stars if not for the conditions of the hotel rooms. My recommendation would be to stay in the villa. Gather a few friends or family members to book the villa. We had a great steamboat dinner together as a huge group. In short, I was very surprise by the quality of our stay here. Highly recommended!",Sep 2014,September 2014,Families

Check in was simple and fast. However, the villas are far from the reception and we had to travel to and fro by car. If you dont have a car, then you are in trouble. Now the villa.....we took a two bedroom villa. I have to say the villa was nice and adequately decorated. The small hot jacuzzi pool was nice and private. The villa was equipped with basic cooking facilities.  Food wise, you should be prepared to either cook or if you have a car, go out to Sungkai town or Bidor to eat. Hotel food was not great. In fact, there were no really good commercial level restaurants around for tourists.My greatest disappointment of this place is actually the service. Poor and unprofessional. Though I did not experience any of them being rude, I was disappointed with the level of service or the lack of it. Imagine the housekeeping people who wanted to replenish toiletries in the villa just put them in a small blue trash bag and handed it to me to sort them out.  This is just one of several incidents that showed poor level of service and lack of professionalism.Apart from the hot springs, there are no other activities at the hotel.  The karaoke was also not available.  As for the pools, they are also open to public who pay for day use. So expect the pools to be packed during holidays.Finally, to sum things up, we initially booked to stay for two to three nights. However, we left after one night. Sad actually, as the villa was nice, worth trying it for a night before you get bored and just do not want to face poor service.If they can improve on some of the above, I am sure their ratings will go up.

This villa was supposed to come with a private hot water jacuzzi, however the hot water was only available from 5.00 pm to 7.00 pm. The rest of the time the water was freezing cold. We chosed the rm 1100 villa hoping that we can have a nice dip in the hot water jacuzzi in privacy. We really felt cheated as this was not mentioned in the website. They advertised as exclusive villa with private hot water jacuzzi.2. The power sockets in the kitchenette were disfunctional.3. The kitchen utensils were dirty.4. Water heater in room no 2 was not functioning.5. The mountain spring pool only starts operation at 11 am. This is really an advantage for residence as the check out time is as 12 noon, thus the children only have less than 1 hour to play in the pool.Good points:1. Reception staff were fast and courteous.2. Maintenance respond were prompt for our complaints.3. The overall ambience of the resort was excellent, nestled amongst the oil palm plantation with nice hot springs and pool.4. Egg boiling  in the hot water spring is a novel experience.5. The therapeutic garden is good with multiple small hot water pools of different degree of water temperature and a therapeutic pebble stone path immersed in hot water.This resort is suitable for people who love nature and who come for the purpose of experiencing the therapeutic properties of the hot water spring.Would I come again?Definitely for the the above reason. However the management should improve  the maintainence of the so called exclusive villa. The private hot water jacuzzi should be available for longer duration - timing should be specified properly in the website so as the patrons don't fill cheated.

I can't wait to write a review on this because I am really very angry with this place. I came here with 24 of my colleagues for a 2D1N stay. We booked 3 villas which cost us around RM3400. We don't think that the money we paid was worthwhile at all! The whole stay was terrible! Some of the bed sheets were dirty and we had to call them to change for us. The hair dryer cannot be used too. And what got us so mad was that we booked this villa just because of the private jacuzzi in each villa but they didn't work at all! We waited until we checked out but no hot water at all. What is a jacuzzi without hot water? Called the technician to check, they came and fixed things, but still no hot water. We tried calling and ask again, they told us they will on it at 7pm. But we waited until 12am at night, water is still so cold. Called again to complain, and they said will call us back, but they didn't! And worse thing was, the villa that i stayed, 2 of the bathrooms have got no hot water too. Only the master bedroom's hot water is working. i had to move my stuffs there to bathe. And guess what, the bathroom's light isn't working as well! So we all had to bathe in the dark! So people out there, do not be deceived by the photos of the villa! They look nice and tempting, but do not be cheated! We complained again when we check out at the reception. But the staffs were not friendly at all. Just asked us to fill up a complain form and said will get back to us (i'm not so stupid to believe that they will!).

Called the maintanence to repair, but still couldn't use it. About the bed, it was BROKEN when we slept on it. There was sound of ""crack"" and we were wondering what was it. When we looked under the bed, it was the 2nd support of the timber that was broken. It was broken before and what they did was to support it with the 2nd supporter, but the 2nd was broken when we slept on it. It was a King size bed and it looked OLD. We were not that heavy to broke the bed (my husband and I both weigh 85kg and 57kg plus a 6 months old baby, how heavy it would be to damage the bed?)The 2nd bedroom is nice too with 2 single beds but the bathroom only have shower (with working water heater).If you are bringing extra person, they will normally charge RM 60 per person (adult) and RM 40 (kids).But you can just tell them there's no extra person when checking-in and they won't charge you.But do tell them if there will be another car coming with you, they will provide car sticker for the other car (if not the Polis Bantuan (security guard) will not allow the 2nd car in).Breakfast was just ok. However, they tea and coffe were not hot at all!The creamer couldn't dissolve in the water because the tea and coffe was not even warm.When complaint to the waitreses, they just said it's hot enough. That was funny. That place was called Hotspring yet the tea and coffe were not even warm.I complaint to the Manager about the bed and breakfast but he listened with no positive feedback.When checked-out, we were given RM50 discount because of the broken bed.Overall, it was a great vacation those problems were not taken into account.",Oct 2010,October 2010,Couples

The resort itself was quiet and beautifully landscaped but the park was quite crowded, mostly with daytrippers - most armed with trays upon trays of eggs to be boiled at the hottest pool!  The rooms were OK but housekeeping could be a bit more diligent with the bathrooms.  Also the ventilation system in the bathroom was out and there were already signs of mould damage on the ceiling.The kids were amazed at the phenomenon of the thermal pools of varying temperatures but being kids, loved the slides at the cold pool the most!  As it had rained in the morning, they could also tolerate the hot pool but there were bits of algae floating all over the pool.  They hated it and it was also disconcerting for the adults.  There was algae all over the sides of the hot pool- probably due to the rich mineral content of the water?  As the place is literally in the middle of a palm oil plantation, a night walk to listen to all the bugs and admire the clear night sky is a must. We found the menu at the coffee house quite limited.  This could have been because it was Hari Raya Holidays.  Breakfast Buffet was limited and the only eggs that were served were supposedly half boiled but turned out raw!  Surprising as just a few metres away there were hundreds of people having hard boiled eggs at the hot springs :-)My biggest tip would be to call the place directly when booking and not through their website.  I made a booking for the deluxe room through their official website for RM250 a night but when we reached the place there were brochures everywhere advertising the place for RM220/night on weekends and holidays.  Upon enquiry, I was told that I was not eligible for that rate as I had booked online.  Tried arguing that internet bookings save their staff''s time, etc., etc and should be cheaper but the front desks' defence was that they had to pay for the online booking service...??  Left it at that as I didn't think the amount warranted spoiling our holiday but just want to make sure that others would not be short changed.  Please DO call them when booking and take up their time - just to make sure you get that RM30 discount!",Sep 2010,September 2010,Families

Rate was RM450 per villa, with extra charges of RM50 per child per night. With that you get accommodation, extra sheets for 1 single foam mattress (no duvet or blanket), breakfast & dinner and entry to the hot springs park for the duration of your stay.The villa was fantastic, with large lounge, kitchen, patio and private outdoor whirlpool bath. For the latter, both hot and cold water is piped in from the springs. Excellent hot spring water for the evening we came and the next morning. However, the hot spring water supply was disrupted at around 10 am. Supply was slow and sporadic until we checked out at 12 pm the 3rd day. Bit of a disappointment there. When I complained a few times, reasons stated ranged from high demand/occupancy to maintenance works.Food was quite a disappointment, given the fact that we were paying a premium for the stay and that there was no decent alternatives in the Sungkai area that I knew of (we were in a oil palm plantation after all). Breakfast and dinner for villa guests were served at the Villa Lounge. Dinner was a buffet of white rice with dishes. Dessert was a local sweet porridge with cut fruits. Although choices were limited, there was plenty of it. Breakfast, however, was a different story. There was a buffet of nasi lemak, noodles, sausages, congee, fruits and an egg station.  However, due to a severe shortage of staff, food was slow to be replenished. At one stage the food had run out and even the egg-station chef was not around. Some of the guests had to resort to cooking their own omelettes!In conclusion, I felt that the villas were very comfortable and exclusive. However, at RM450 minimum per night (the weekend rates are higher and the 2-bedroom villas are pricier), important details such as F&B should be improved.",Mar 2010,March 2010,Families

Our bad service experience:- 1) Never informed of how to turn on the hot water spring. We ended up with cold spring. 2) Was not informed of the breakfast area. So, our troop had to drive to the main hotel area for breakfast, and the selection was not that great.However said, the room is clean and comfortable. Villa comes with cosy lounge and kitchen.

Well made, well stocked and very spacious. We liked the arrangement of hot water from hot sprints directly into our villa jacuzzi. They even serviced it twice a day. Great help!2) Landscaping: They have this huge property and they have landscaped it very well. Thoroughly liked it for morning and evening walks.3) Service & Food: You say it and they will have it (at times before you say) with smile. We are vegetarians and they didn't had too many options, so when I told them before my first dinner, they made the arrangement within an hour (and always afterward). They gave us good choice in vegetarian food. When we were too lazy to come to restaurant for breakfast they send it to our villa - good choice again and good enough quantity to last for double the people.4) Spa: Both the malay spa and Ayurvedic spa guys were good at their job.But they can still improve at two things -1. Some spa staff didn't knew english - at such a good resort they should have staff which can handle non-Malaysian people.2.

Initially, I was reluctant, but because my hubby insisted, we did go. Now, I'm glad we did :DThe journey from Kuala Lumpur is quite short..only an hour's drive. If you keep it at 120 km/h that is, hihi. Hence, this place is ideal for a short getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. We arrived at the resort around 12PM. The 1st thing we saw when we were almost there is an idyllic Felda village, it feels just like going back to one's kampung. With all the rustic houses, trees and scenery, this itself was very relaxing & comforting. A bit further in, we came to the resort's main entrance. First impression: this place is huge and..hot! There are hardly any trees/shade as the trees there still haven't grown fully yet. Although we arrived 2 hours early, we were allowed an early check-in. The reception staff's service is good, very smooth. We enquired about the occupancy at the villas,  as we were there on a Monday. The reception staff told us we were the only guest staying at the villas for that day. Owwkaayyy...We booked a 2 room villa. Let me tell you one thing...that place is humongous! Spaaaaacious to the max! Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a staff named Syafik, who was always smiling and is super duper friendly & helpful..excellent! He showed us around the villa, explaining everything and showing us how to operate the jacuzzi, etc. Then we settled in.The 2-room villa feels very homely & cozy. The sheer size of it makes it ideal for a family, the whole place can probably fit a family of 6-7 people very comfortably...in the master bedroom alone! Trust me, it's that big! Plus, there's a kitchen with dining table, complete with a gas stove, cooking utensils, a rice cooker, a fridge..practically the only thing you have to bring if you've a mind to cook yourself is the food stuff! There's also a big LCD tv in the living room, which also has comfortable sofas.  As for the 2nd bedroom. it was also very spacious..there were 2 single beds, which are very comfortable. The whole villa is decorated with exotic wall decorations, I felt in love with them right away. Outside the villa's front door, there's the private jacuzzi (which can seat 4-5 adults at a time) plus there's a pangkin (a traditional Malay wooden platform used as a verandah/porch) next to the jacuzzi. I'd say it's the perfect hang out spot for the whole family. In short, the 2-room villas was stupendously amazing..we loved it so much!We sorted our stuff into the villa right away, as we were in a rush to sample all the things the resort has to offer, i.e going for a swim in the hot springs and cold mountain water pool. But before we left, we found out that the A/C in the 2nd bedroom is not blowing in cool air. So we called Syafik at the reception to remedy the situation while we were out swimming. He said okay and he'd send the maintenance guys soon.Thus, we went out for a swim at the hot springs pool first. On the way there, we met a senior staff of the resort, Pakcik Haji Said. He was very helpful and friendly and he showed us all aroung the resort, explaining everything we came upon. We were very grateful, I don't think we'd appreciate that place as much as we did if he didn't show us around, what an excellent tour guide..fun too! Hmm, I think I'll just list down some of the major attractions they have, and you can find out more about them on your own:- Cold mountain springs pool (fun, especially for kids & adults alike, as there are 2 excellent water slides)- Hot  springs pool (very hot, around 40 degrees C. Not suitable for kids. One can only soak in the  pool for max 20 minutes, and then you have to go out to have a drink as you'll be sweating like crazy)- Natural sauna - fun fun fun, you just walk along a boardwalk surrounded by trees & greenery, in the shade, and underneath the boardwalk there's a hot spring running it's course, so the heat gets to you from underneath. You'll end up feeling like you're in a vast open air sauna)-Egg boiling activity - buy eggs at the canteen and dip them into a pool of boiling hot water, all natural around 100 degress C..your egg will be ready to eat in minutes...extra extra yummy!-A Malay traditional spa & an Ayurvedic spa - fabulous, my 1st positive massage experience.-and several others. like bicycle rides, tram rides, etc.Once we're done doing all the acitivities, we came back to our villa at around 6PM+..only to find out the A/C in the 2nd bedroom is still broken down. We called the technician once again. He checked the unit and said it'd require a contractor's repair job. The techie went back to call the contractor..and that's when we discovered the A/C in that room wasn't only non-functioning, but the ceiling near it is leaking water onto the floor as well! What the...?! We quickly called the reception..and thus the conflict began. We told them about the leaking ceiling, and they sent us 2 housekeeping staffs..what for? We then requested for them to transfer us to another villa, to which they replied there are none available..duhh, weren't we the only ones there on that day? They told us that earlier! Then, even more stupidity..they told us to transfer to a 1 room villa and they'll give us an extra bed..totally unacceptable, we paid so much for 2 rooms and now we'll only get 1 room and a camp bed..no way jose! Needless to say, after much haranguing and bickering, they finally let us transfer to a 3 room villa at no extra charge..even though the price per night is more than RM300 difference than the 2 room villa. That was the worst argument I've had in a long time..lalalalalalala :pBefore transferring to the 3 room villa, we decided to go for dinner at the resort's restaurant first. As there were so few guests there that day, they didn't serve us in a buffet style, but rather it was ala carte. No matter, as the food was really delicious..contrary to what all the other reviewers said. Or maybe we were just hungry. Nevertheless, the food was good and we were satisfied. The next morning we had breakfast there, ala carte as well, quite nice as well..nasi lemak & toast. Delicious indeed.After that, we transferred  to the 3 room villa. We were very very impressed & surprised by the 3 room villa..it was fabulous! Even more so than the 2 room villa. Just imagine..the jacuzzi is in the house! Complete with a mini garden, a huge living room, a big kitchen complete with microwave oven etc...it was fantastic! Sadly, the pangkin is nowhere to be found..plus the 2nd & 3rd bedroom is a bit smaller than the one we had at the 2 room villa. But it was still good..you can't have it all I guess. Somehow, I prefer the rooms in the 3 room villa. See my photos attached, only then you'll get a better idea of the place.On our 2nd day there, my SIL insisted that we try the traditional Malay spa..I've never been to one before, so I was a bit apprehensive. I chose to have the ""Malay Relaxing Massage"" for RM90, 1 hour (very very cheap!). The lady who massaged me was named Masnah (I think so)..she gave me a superb massage and she was very nice & likeable. The massage rooms were spacious & well decorated too. I loved it.In conclusion, I think this place is magnificient..you just have to pick a right time to come, and hope that the rooms you'll get will have no problems. We'll definitely come back again for a relaxing getaway. And lastly, thanks so much to my SIL for inviting us! :D",Feb 2010,January 2010,Couples

The villa appears to be failry new and well maintained.  Rooms are spacious and decent.  We all enjoyed the in-villa jacuzzi.  The mountain spring pool and the warm pool is also large and nice.  The kids also enjoyed the various hot spring pool around the resort compound.  We are however disappointed with the dinner that was being offered as part of the package.  Another surprise we had was the state of landscaping that was going on in the villa ground, it was messy and filled with chopped trees and mud everywhere along the foot path and for some reason, we could smell cow dung around our villa, they must have used it for fertilizer, not very pleasant when we went for our walks.  The quality of the food is not good and selection is bad. In our first night there, we arrived at the restaurant at 730pm (dinner officially starts at 7pm) and most of the food were already finished and the food was slow in getting replenished.  The food was quite tasteless but we had no other choice as that was the only facility available in the resort.  In one of the dessert corner, the food was filled with flies and the waiters didn't make any attempt to remove it.  Someone must have complained about the food as there were several more dishes next day but equally tastless and bland.The resort could do with better signage around the resort.  we had to drive around the dark in the evening when we went for dinner and got lost several times because signage was lacking and the roads were pitched dark around the resort.WIFI was only available in the lobby and villa lounge which we find it inconvenient to walk all the way there with our lap top to access.Overall, it was a very relaxing and pleasant stay.
