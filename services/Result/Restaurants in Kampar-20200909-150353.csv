The curry was very salty and the contents consist of all tough breast meat and a miserable piece of potatoes.The fried noodles was nothing to write home about though the portion was quite big. There was ample portions of vegetables and some medium sized prawns in it.The oyster sauced green leafy vegetable dish was just an ordinary dish, a little overcooked.We paid about RM76 for the meal .I do not think I will visit the place again as I feel it is not worth the hassle to drive 2 hours from Kuala Lumpur for something mediocre.In fact it would be better to have a delicious curry chicken and order some sweet bread to dip in.After the meal, I drove about 5 minutes to the Kampar Sacred Heart Church.The beautifully manicured lawn and the clean, peaceful and beautiful interior of the church made up fir the disappointing meal",9 September 2017 ,August 2017,None

The pan fried prawns was fried briefly in oil, and then cooked with a dash of soy sauce together with some spring onions. A hint of sugar was added to caramelized the prawns slightly. It worked very well, as the taste was really good. Don't bother peeling off the shell of the prawns, as the shell was crispy enough to be eaten.As we were seated outside next to the fish tanks, we saw a worker scooping up the live prawns in one the tank. Two large prawns plain steam was next to arrived, the bright reddish hue on the prawns is a sure sign of the freshness of the prawns. The prawns were steamed with some ginger strips, egg white, light soy sauce and a hint of aromatic chinese wine. The taste was great and fragrance, and the prawns was succulent, sweet and fresh.The water spinach was well done, with just the right amount dried scrimps and chilli and not too oily and salty.Our bill for our dinner comes up to RM 110, including a pot of chinese tea and plain rice, which I feel was reasonable.

So naturally, who wouldn't want the bigger prawns. Instead they chose the smallest and when I asked them why weren't they giving any of the bigger ones, they just said they were all reserved.Later when the bill came, the prawns were charged as medium sized prawns (I have eaten a few times in other restaurants at Tualang. The prawns they served us was smaller than the smallest I ever had. Most were not bigger than my last finger. Furthermore, they initially said the prawns came in only 1 size.

I brought 4 of my Kuala Lumpur friends to dine here for lunch on a Sunday, we took a leisurely drive from Ipoh at 10.30am and arrived in Tanjung Tualang at 11.30am. I had made reservations in this Yew Kei restaurant 2 weeks earlier, however, since it wasn't a long weekend or a festive season, this town was pretty quiet. We ordered a plate of large steamed big-headed freshwater prawns, a plate of medium soy-sauce dry stir fried big-headed freshwater prawns, a steamed marble Goby fish(in Cantonese: Soon Hock), a dish of tofu(beancurd) and a dish of stir fried vegetables. The steamed prawns was absolutely fabulous, as was the stir fried prawns! If you decide to dine here, these 2 prawn dishes are their specialty and both styles are totally worth the journey here!! The steamed fish was also very good but the prawns were definitely the highlight of our meal here. 2 important note to all visitors: 1)The prices of the freshwater prawns and the fish are charged according to weight and they vary from restaurant to restaurant. I had done my homework before making my reservations in this particular restaurant and their prices, at the time of my dining here, were the most reasonable. The large freshwater prawns cost RM130 per kilogram, the medium prawns cost RM90 per kilogram, the marble Goby fish cost RM135 per kilogram. Some of the other restaurants in this little town quoted me RM150 per kilogram for their large freshwater prawns and RM110 for their medium freshwater prawns. Therefore, please don't get ripped-off by the other more fancy-looking restaurants.2) During the school holidays, public holidays, long weekends and festive seasons, all the restaurants in Tanjung Tualang usually get very busy, therefore, if you are planning a trip here during such an occasion, please make your reservations prior to your trip in order to avoid long waits for a table or complete disappointment.I wish everyone reading this review a great time dining here and safe travels always!",22 October 2019 ,October 2019,None

This message was totally ignored. We start at 08:30 pm to ask the waiter why it takes so long with the food, no reaction. 10 minutes later my wife call the manager and express our disappointment . 10 minutes later the first dish arrived. After the first dish we have to wait another 25 minutes, too long for us, especially for the children age between 2.5 to 5 years.

Although it's only a small town, it has been well-known to the locals for decades as THE place to go for freshwater prawns. Our family drove in two cars from Ipoh on a Tuesday evening and arrived in Tualang, to find that many of the restaurants were closed. We were initially quite worried that it would be a futile trip, but managed to find a couple of open restaurants. Based on our past experience, we made sure that before settle down in any restaurant, we checked with them if they still have any prawns and what is their size. On our previous trip, we did not ask beforehand and ended up with a disappointing meal with only small prawns. Indeed, the first restaurant we entered told us he had big prawns, but showed us deep frozen prawns (not live prawns). The second restaurant told us honestly he has run out of prawns, but kindly directed us to Restaurant Kim Wah around the corner. When we entered Restaurant Kim Wah, we were a little worried how much the meal will cost, as the place is big and looks quite posh. The ten of us had 8 dishes - 2 dishes of prawns (1.5 kg in all), 1 dish of codfish, 1 fish, 1 dish of stir-fried cuttlefish, 2 vegetables, 1 claypot dofu. The meal costed Ringgit Malaysia 360 (USD110). The price is very reasonable, excellent value for money. The food is delicious. Conclusion - we could have ordered more prawns given the bill. We will be back again.",12 April 2014 ,April 2014,None
